1
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:23,482
ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS DEPICTED
IN THIS SERIES ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:26,068
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED SAFELY IN
THE PRESENCE OF THEIR GUARDIANS.

3
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:07,002
{\an8}Where are we? Huh?

4
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:08,462
{\an8}It's also my first time here.

5
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:27,898
{\an8}That scared me!

6
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:29,275
{\an8}Something was moving there!

7
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:50,629
What is that?

8
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,673
I'll get my revenge.

9
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:56,093
I'll get my revenge.

10
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,640
Su-ryeon...

11
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:03,559
Su-ryeon!

12
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:05,144
I'll get my revenge.

13
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,189
Lee Su-ryeon.

14
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:10,774
It's you, right?

15
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:12,484
Right?

16
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,820
I'll get my revenge.

17
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:20,576
It's a spirit that lived
in the sacred tree of Bonhyangdang.

18
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,828
Apparently, it listens
to mistreated people

19
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:24,663
and helps them relieve their resentment.

20
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:26,457
I'll get my revenge.

21
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:32,046
I'll get my revenge!

22
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:33,172
Mi-ho!

23
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,885
Mi-ho, are you okay?

24
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,972
-Stay back.
-Yes, sure.

25
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,227
Damn it!

26
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:02,868
Mi-ho!

27
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,269
Van!

28
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:34,024
Didn't I tell you to only move
with my permission?

29
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,904
We came to Su-ryeon's home,

30
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:41,740
but I have no idea where we are
or what's going on.

31
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,826
This is a forest created by Benjulle.

32
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,035
Benjulle's forest?

33
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:48,580
Su-ryeon.

34
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:51,208
We have to save her first.
Please save her quickly!

35
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,626
Law of Causality.

36
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:54,586
What is the "Law of Causality?"

37
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:56,630
Excuse me.

38
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:58,090
It was a price
for relieving her resentment.

39
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,425
I can't break the Law of Causality.

40
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:02,094
She's still just a child.

41
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,639
She made a wrong decision
because she was scared and terrified.

42
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,058
It was a decision she made.

43
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:11,020
And I'll tell you one more time.
This is not part of our agreement.

44
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:13,439
You coward.

45
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,446
Hey, excuse me.

46
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,448
-What?
-I said you're a coward.

47
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,950
-Say it again. What did you just say?
-You coward.

48
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:27,619
It's not the time for you two to fight,
a person is dying here--

49
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:30,539
I'm right, no? You're running away
out of fear of that monster.

50
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,791
I've never been called that in my life.

51
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,585
You think I'll be scared of Benjulle?

52
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,003
I'm sure you've heard it many times.

53
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:37,546
I think you're scared now too.

54
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,131
Why can't you save her then?

55
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,010
I already told you earlier.

56
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,512
-It's a decision she made.
-What a great excuse.

57
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:47,056
Hey... Hey!

58
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,641
We made an agreement.
You've even been paid already.

59
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,727
So do as I tell you.
Go save her right now.

60
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:52,978
Shit, hey!

61
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,613
Don't order me around like that.

62
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:05,783
You coward.

63
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:08,786
Mi-ho!

64
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,499
Mi-ho. Really...

65
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:15,918
Mi-ho, are you okay?

66
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:17,002
Yes.

67
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,332
Really, what is that thing?

68
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,372
Mi-ho!

69
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:42,629
Van!

70
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:49,386
Van!

71
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,557
Van!

72
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,725
Van!

73
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:05,819
Why are you getting in the way?

74
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,739
I'm finally about to get my revenge.

75
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,407
Su-ryeon.

76
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,493
Please get out of there.
Come home with me.

77
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,078
Shut your mouth!

78
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,916
I'm not going back.

79
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,086
You have no idea
what that bastard did to me.

80
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,130
Even my mom and dad
can't help me with this.

81
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:27,049
No one can do it.

82
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:29,468
I'm going to do it!

83
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,678
I'll help you, okay?

84
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,013
Really.

85
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,098
I promise you.

86
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,642
Don't make me laugh!

87
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:38,602
I'm going to do it myself.

88
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:42,481
Benjulle is going to take that bastard
to hell with him.

89
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,235
He'll end everything for me!

90
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:47,903
Lee Su-ryeon.

91
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:52,699
Benjulle, Benjulle.

92
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:57,412
Please come down quickly
and hear out my grudge.

93
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,582
I perform this rite
with sincerity like this

94
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,002
and serve you, Benjulle.

95
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:07,756
Please avenge the person
who made me like this.

96
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:11,176
In return, please take my body.

97
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,182
Su-ryeon!

98
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:19,268
Lee Su-ryeon!

99
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:22,312
Let go of me!

100
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:23,563
Lee Su-ryeon!

101
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:11,278
Su-ryeon...

102
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:14,489
Su-ryeon.

103
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,615
Su-ryeon!

104
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:17,868
Lee Su-ryeon!

105
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:20,537
Revenge?

106
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,584
This monster is not a god
who'll take revenge for you.

107
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,920
Yeom-ji told you this, right?

108
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:31,715
Benjulle is a spirit that helps
with resolving grudges.

109
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,718
But what revenge
did this Benjulle take for you?

110
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:38,805
Did it cut off his arms and legs,
or carve out his heart?

111
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:43,352
Benjulle.

112
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:45,979
What about my revenge?

113
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:47,856
Benjulle.

114
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,490
Listen to me closely.

115
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,577
I'll take your revenge for you.

116
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,912
I can do it for you.

117
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:04,915
I was a little late,
so you're like this now,

118
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:10,212
but I'll do whatever I can to make sure
he is punished for what he did.

119
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:15,217
I'll do it for you. I promise.

120
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:23,100
Please save me.

121
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,143
I'll save you.

122
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,979
I'll help you.

123
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,651
Let's get out of here together, okay?

124
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,287
Su-ryeon!

125
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,295
Please save me!

126
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:53,964
Su-ryeon.

127
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:07,078
Oh.

128
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:09,039
Su-ryeon.

129
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:19,007
Su-ryeon!

130
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:23,512
Su-ryeon.

131
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:24,930
Su-ryeon.

132
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,182
Are you okay?

133
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:32,020
Don't worry. I think she just passed out.

134
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,104
Is that so?

135
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:37,442
How do we get out of here?

136
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,171
Let's go.

137
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,903
Are you okay, Mi-ho?

138
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,530
Yes.

139
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:25,907
I'm not okay.

140
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,063
How about Su-ryeon?

141
00:14:58,481 --> 00:14:59,524
In the room next door.

142
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,276
Did Benjulle die?

143
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,697
Benjulle is the spirit of the forest.
It doesn't die.

144
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,198
It returned to the forest.

145
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:08,908
What do you...

146
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:13,204
It relieves others' grudges at a price,

147
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:15,123
but it doesn't take vicious revenge
like this.

148
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,877
What was that thing then?

149
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,839
I think it was polluted by lust demons.

150
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:24,132
Lust demons?

151
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:27,302
Lust demons.

152
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,390
-So that means...
-You're right.

153
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,770
They were after you,
using that child as bait.

154
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:38,396
No...

155
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:40,148
No.

156
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,777
Why! Why on earth? What did I do wrong?

157
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,280
So in the end,

158
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:50,408
are you saying
Su-ryeon went through that because of me?

159
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,247
Normally, you'd say "No,"
in a situation like this.

160
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:00,377
So tactless.

161
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:06,424
-Where are you going?
-I'm off to do bad things.

162
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:08,635
Okay?

163
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,017
Please take good care of her, doctor.

164
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:19,396
Hello.

165
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:24,567
How is Su-ryeon?

166
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:29,155
Upon examination, there was nothing wrong.

167
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:35,036
But we'll have to check the progress
to see if she can wake up from the coma.

168
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,914
Please take extra good care of her.

169
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,167
-Dr. Yang.
-I will, Miss.

170
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:43,128
Thank you.

171
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:51,386
Ms. Won.

172
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:54,723
Thank you so much.

173
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:59,394
Su-ryeon will be fine, right?

174
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:02,522
We didn't even realize
she was in this state.

175
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,983
How can we possibly thank you?

176
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:13,700
Su-ryeon will be fine, so don't worry.

177
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:15,285
Thank you.

178
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,504
You're right.

179
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:29,048
They were after you,
using that child as bait.

180
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:34,512
It's me.

181
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:47,025
Mi-ho.

182
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,694
What are you doing here?

183
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:50,779
Stop.

184
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:57,076
Stop? Okay.

185
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,079
-What are you?
-Sorry?

186
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,332
What's your identity?

187
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,417
Mi-ho--

188
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:06,002
Tell me straight.

189
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:08,046
Who are you really?

190
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:13,259
So all the strange things
you went through here,

191
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,221
I came to investigate those.

192
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:20,433
So you knew everything from the beginning

193
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:22,560
and approached me intentionally, right?

194
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:27,357
And that means Butler Chang
knew everything, but still--

195
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,692
I found out and came myself.

196
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,325
What did you find out then?

197
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:40,328
About what?

198
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:42,455
You said you were investigating.

199
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:48,670
I think bad things are happening
because of me.

200
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:50,797
And I feel like they will keep happening.

201
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,048
Is that how it really is?

202
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:56,928
Whatever you went through,
or will go through in the future...

203
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:01,099
They're not going to be bad.

204
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:04,435
How do you know?

205
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,646
How can I not know?

206
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:09,607
You saved Su-ryeon yourself,
saying that it was your decision.

207
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,154
At least, you're better than someone.

208
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,950
That prick.

209
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,660
Tactless and stupid fool.

210
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:23,746
Can I ask you something?

211
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:28,042
How about you keep your distance a little
from that tactless fool?

212
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,964
I can't believe even Benjulle
became a lust demon.

213
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:34,841
They should be punished by the heavens.

214
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:38,803
How dare they do that
to the divine spirits of Tamra?

215
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:40,847
This is really serious.

216
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:46,352
They are becoming more shrewd,
but you have to continue fighting alone.

217
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:48,688
I'm deeply worried

218
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:52,442
that you might turn to their side
when you fight using the energy of demons.

219
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:53,568
That won't happen.

220
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:57,322
How can you be so certain?

221
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,741
I've seen things with my own eyes.

222
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,581
All right, you punk.

223
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,960
It's because I couldn't die,
so my intelligence wouldn't go away.

224
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:12,795
Should I eliminate that intelligence?

225
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:14,672
This bastard!

226
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:17,717
By the way,

227
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:22,847
it was for a brief moment,
but I felt her energy.

228
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:25,767
What I'm feeling is true, right?

229
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:28,269
You've seen her yourself.

230
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:32,440
Yes, you're right.

231
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:34,734
Oh, wow.

232
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:37,487
Finally, some good news, right?

233
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:43,993
But why do you look so anxious?

234
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,499
Benjulle was polluted.

235
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,336
So there was someone behind it?

236
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:56,756
I'm not too sure yet.

237
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,093
You should also be careful for now.

238
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,345
Why are you leaving
in the middle of a conversation?

239
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,930
It makes me uncomfortable.

240
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:07,809
Finish what you were saying, you punk!

241
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:08,893
That punk.

242
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:19,654
Granny!

243
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:21,990
I gave him free food again.
What will you do about it?

244
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:23,908
Stop being so fussy.

245
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:25,702
-I'm hungry.
-What?

246
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,496
I said I'm hungry.

247
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,373
Here, have this.

248
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,458
This is untouched.

249
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:24,260
Come in.

250
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:29,307
Please look into him.

251
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:33,227
Please find out everything about him,
his job, education, assets, parents,

252
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:36,272
friends, women, and even what he got
for his first birthday.

253
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,150
Miss, do you have to do--

254
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:43,279
Exactly. I'm asking you to do it
so that I don't have to do it.

255
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,156
-Miss!
-I know

256
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:47,200
what you're going to say.

257
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:51,370
"You came here because you caused trouble,
and you're looking for more trouble."

258
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:52,705
"Aren't you stupid?"

259
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:54,707
-"Please get a hold of yourself."
-When did I--

260
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,584
"You're going to be the death of me."

261
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,961
Until when do I have to clean up
after you?

262
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:01,089
I'm already old enough.

263
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:03,591
-Please stop being like that.
-I'm on my way now.

264
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,426
I was already on my way.

265
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:15,812
She has shown her strength.

266
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:20,108
I think it won't be long
before she is awakened.

267
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:23,694
<i>It is evidence</i>
<i>that we're getting closer to the time.</i>

268
00:23:23,778 --> 00:23:25,530
The problem...

269
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:27,198
is the man in black.

270
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:31,828
He has the power of a lust demon,

271
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:33,663
but he is protecting her.

272
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,039
<i>Protecting her?</i>

273
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,083
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

274
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,627
He's definitely as dangerous

275
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,296
as it was stated in the prophecy.

276
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,341
But...

277
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:51,347
I have a feeling

278
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:54,225
that he is not going to harm her.

279
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:58,354
It is also true

280
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:01,774
that he has saved her
from dangerous situations multiple times.

281
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:04,902
<i>He has already harmed Wonjeong</i>
<i>once before, hasn't he?</i>

282
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:10,241
<i>The prophecy is sacred</i>
<i>and has never been wrong.</i>

283
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:13,161
<i>Keep in mind, Pastor Johan.</i>

284
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:18,332
<i>It is your mission to awaken her</i>

285
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:21,169
<i>so she can establish</i>
<i>the protective barrier.</i>

286
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,381
<i>You must keep her safe</i>
<i>from danger at all costs.</i>

287
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:29,093
I guess there is no other way then.

288
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,681
Except to throw myself in there.

289
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:52,825
Mi-ho trusts you a lot.

290
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:54,368
Did you know?

291
00:24:56,621 --> 00:24:58,247
But I'm not sure why she does.

292
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:02,501
Firstly, looking at the appearance...

293
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:05,671
And the personality...

294
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:12,386
Do you consider yourself trustworthy?

295
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:18,976
How did it feel?

296
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:22,688
To meet her again?

297
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:27,568
Was that question too difficult?

298
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:31,822
Should I have asked how it felt
to meet someone who you killed again?

299
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:36,452
Is it true?

300
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:38,829
So it is true.

301
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:42,667
Wow. To be honest, I wasn't entirely sure

302
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,962
whether the prophecy was true or not.

303
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:47,463
But then...

304
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:52,593
Right now, I can make you feel
how the people who were killed by me felt.

305
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:04,814
Maybe next time. I'm busy now.

306
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:06,774
I need to go to some nice restaurants.

307
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:09,694
You could say I'm going on a pilgrimage.

308
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:12,697
Why do you keep looking at me?

309
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:14,865
I know I'm a bit charming.

310
00:26:15,283 --> 00:26:17,118
I'll be heading off then.
And next time,

311
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,744
please give me an answer.

312
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,588
Yoon Gyeong-jun, 22.

313
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:32,300
He's currently on leave of absence
at Tamra High School.

314
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:37,555
But Miss, may I ask
the real reason for this?

315
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:40,558
It's nothing important.

316
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:43,978
I'm just angry.

317
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:48,107
And I'm only satisfied
if I pay back twice as much as I get.

318
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:50,318
And I'm able to do so too.

319
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:57,199
I also want to brag
that I punished a bad guy.

320
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:02,163
Someone will release a nice article
about how good I was then.

321
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:05,541
-Who will?
-Our very own capable Butler Chang will.

322
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:11,172
<i>There were many similar cases</i>
<i>to Su-ryeon's.</i>

323
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:16,010
<i>Many cases were suspected</i>
<i>to be dating violence or stalking.</i>

324
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:20,014
But he was never legally punished,
not even once.

325
00:27:22,058 --> 00:27:24,352
He was never punished even once?

326
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:36,530
<i>The fact that Yoon Gyeong-jun's father</i>
<i>is an influential director</i>

327
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:39,533
<i>in Jeju Island society</i>
<i>also had an influence.</i>

328
00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:42,203
Also, everything was pointing towards him
in all cases,

329
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:48,084
but they were not accepted
because there was no supporting evidence.

330
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:51,670
It was the same for Su-ryeon.

331
00:27:53,756 --> 00:27:55,549
I gave you Su-ryeon's cellphone, right?

332
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:57,176
Have you analyzed it yet?

333
00:27:57,259 --> 00:28:00,971
-I think that's going to be difficult.
-Why?

334
00:28:01,055 --> 00:28:04,392
There is a chat app
called "Silent Chat" installed.

335
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:07,353
But basically, you need the permission--

336
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:09,480
So there is no record left?

337
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:14,985
What about asking the developer?

338
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:17,196
Wouldn't they have a back-up?

339
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,617
The reason for the app's popularity
was its high security.

340
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:26,288
But there were endless incidents
as people abused its security system.

341
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:30,876
But the company,
using the developer's policy,

342
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,629
has never accepted requests
for investigation cooperation.

343
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:38,008
What if we forcefully obtain it
by hiring a hacker?

344
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:40,845
Of course you'd find evidence
if you hire a hacker.

345
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:44,432
But it won't be accepted as evidence
if you obtain it illegally.

346
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:48,102
We could be making valuable evidence
worthless.

347
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:51,439
-There's no other way, then?
-I didn't say there aren't any.

348
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:54,900
Here are the details of the company
that made "Silent Chat."

349
00:28:55,151 --> 00:28:57,903
It's a startup company
that is not listed yet.

350
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:01,449
It's been found
that they have difficulties with funds.

351
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:04,577
Do I have any spare funds to use--

352
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,661
You have none.

353
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,875
If we have no money to use,

354
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:14,170
we'll use someone who has the money.

355
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:25,014
DAEHAN HOTEL DIRECTOR, WON BO-RAM,
TAKES OVER THE DEVELOPER OF "SILENT CHAT"

356
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:26,307
And what were the terms?

357
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:31,604
I promised that I wouldn't intervene
with Daehan Hotel and Cultural Foundation.

358
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,148
Mister, I must be insane
to do this, right?

359
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,443
It's insane no matter how you look at it.

360
00:29:40,905 --> 00:29:41,906
Only three years?

361
00:29:44,325 --> 00:29:46,994
Prosecutor, have you seen the evidence?

362
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:50,915
He made threats, took photos and videos.
And it's only three years?

363
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,876
The most important thing

364
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:57,838
is whether it was filmed
privately or with consent.

365
00:29:57,922 --> 00:30:03,260
But based just on victim testimonies
and secured evidence,

366
00:30:03,344 --> 00:30:05,554
it is not enough to prove the case.

367
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:07,640
The victim will suffer forever,

368
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:10,392
but only three years
for someone who deserves to be executed?

369
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:12,811
That's how the law is.

370
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:14,855
I'm only asking
for the punishment he deserves.

371
00:30:14,939 --> 00:30:17,608
What law?
What kind of stupid law is that?

372
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:18,692
I...

373
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:23,822
Hello, sir?

374
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:26,075
I'll call you back later.

375
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,160
Sorry?

376
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:39,421
How can this be happening?

377
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:45,219
Miss, the perpetrator will visit
the victim today for an agreement.

378
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:47,304
What did you say?

379
00:30:57,064 --> 00:31:00,401
Everything will be fine, so don't worry.
Tell your father.

380
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:01,485
Yoon Gyeong-jun.

381
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:05,823
You! What are you doing here?

382
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:08,117
Hold on. What are you doing now?

383
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,496
Mr. Yoon Gyeong-jun is here to admit
his mistakes and apologize to the victim.

384
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:14,456
Mistakes?

385
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:16,709
This is crazy.

386
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:20,296
I'm going to do whatever it takes
for you to be punished.

387
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:21,380
Hey, look here!

388
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:22,506
Wait. Just one moment.

389
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,383
-No, no--
-It's fine.

390
00:31:27,678 --> 00:31:28,804
Ms. Won Mi-ho?

391
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:31,807
Hello.

392
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:35,894
So you are the one
who is helping our Su-ryeon.

393
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:39,106
I'm really sorry.

394
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:42,151
Even if we were in a relationship,

395
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:44,987
I shouldn't have done things like that.

396
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:48,991
I shouldn't have recorded
something like that

397
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:51,160
even if our Su-ryeon agreed to it.

398
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:53,912
I'm sorry.

399
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:55,956
I'm so sorry.

400
00:31:56,332 --> 00:31:57,499
I'm really sorry.

401
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:09,887
But what did I do so wrong?

402
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:11,680
You bastard...

403
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:14,808
Hey.

404
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:18,020
Who do you think you are?

405
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:20,606
Going around like this, huh?

406
00:32:21,482 --> 00:32:22,566
Damn it.

407
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:27,863
She was so obedient,
and I wondered why she suddenly changed.

408
00:32:29,198 --> 00:32:30,199
I get it.

409
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:34,244
Do you take pride in thinking
that superior people,

410
00:32:34,328 --> 00:32:36,830
like you and me,
have to be nice and generous?

411
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,459
Nonetheless,

412
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:45,047
Su-ryeon's level is far too low
even to be in the same space, isn't it?

413
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:47,132
Don't try so hard.

414
00:32:48,676 --> 00:32:49,677
Ms. Won Mi-ho.

415
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:53,972
Gyeong-jun.

416
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:57,601
Make sure you hold onto it.
It's a limited edition.

417
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:08,237
Come in.

418
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,751
What is it?

419
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:26,088
If you have something to say, say it.

420
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:28,090
I...

421
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:30,175
Su-ryeon is...

422
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:32,845
She'll be fine soon.

423
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:36,306
She's being looked after
by a highly skilled medical team,

424
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:38,767
so she'll be up in no time.

425
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:42,438
Do you want to visit her?

426
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:44,398
No, it's fine.

427
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:46,692
What happened to that bastard?

428
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:53,699
It's not fair,
but there is not much we can do.

429
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:55,117
Apparently, that's the law.

430
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:57,411
But...

431
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,498
he will be punished for sure.

432
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:06,754
If someone like him is not punished,
those above are neglecting their duties.

433
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:10,090
Whether it be God, Buddha,

434
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:11,925
or even Allah,

435
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:14,762
at least one of them
would be doing their job, right?

436
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:19,349
Thank you.

437
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:38,744
Benjulle.

438
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,792
This belongs to that child.

439
00:34:47,503 --> 00:34:49,671
I think this is enough for the price.

440
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:16,114
Father, I was assaulted, okay?

441
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:18,867
I'm going to sue that bitch.

442
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:21,286
I can't live with taking a loss.

443
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:23,997
Never mind.

444
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:26,917
I'm going to return the favor.

445
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,048
Damn it!

446
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:49,439
Lee Su-ryeon...

447
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,194
Okay, let's see if you can walk proudly
on the streets.

448
00:35:54,278 --> 00:35:55,946
I'm going to upload them all.

449
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:57,739
Look forward to it.

450
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:44,494
Su-ryeon!

451
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:48,582
Mom...

452
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:49,666
Are you awake?

453
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:54,338
Well done, my daughter.

454
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:57,799
Well done, my daughter.

455
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:04,139
Do you know how worried I was?

456
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:14,524
It is you!

457
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:16,526
Sorry?

458
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:18,278
I'm glad you came.

459
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:20,072
I'm really glad you came.

460
00:37:20,781 --> 00:37:22,449
Ma'am, what do you mean?

461
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:27,287
Right. It's not strange
that you don't recognize me.

462
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:31,166
Oh, Mzee Geum Baek-ju.
You're here.

463
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:33,502
Su-jin.

464
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:36,546
-Do you know this lady?
-Of course! Introduce yourself.

465
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:40,175
She is the eldest in the town
that Tamra High School is in.

466
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:43,762
She is the head of <i>haenyeo</i>
who runs a restaurant in the mountains.

467
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:47,099
She donated a large sum of money
she earned from the sea,

468
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:49,851
so we can use it on our students.

469
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:54,356
And she would also occasionally
give rice cakes to teachers like this.

470
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:57,109
I'm Yeom-ji's grandmother.

471
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:58,944
Yeom-ji? Boo Yeom-ji?

472
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:02,656
When you have time,
please visit my restaurant.

473
00:38:03,073 --> 00:38:06,785
You must! I have a lot to tell you.

474
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:10,288
-Ma'am, please take care.
-Okay.

475
00:38:10,706 --> 00:38:11,915
Please take care.

476
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:35,022
You are really impatient, you know?

477
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:38,483
Did you come because you couldn't
get rid of that intelligence?

478
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:42,988
I came because I wanted to see her,
you punk.

479
00:38:44,156 --> 00:38:46,658
She was a child I had in my arms.

480
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:50,871
I missed her and wanted to see her.

481
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:55,042
She looks exactly the same.

482
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:58,545
It reminded me of the old days,

483
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:00,005
so I couldn't help...

484
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:02,549
Anyway,

485
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,594
that's also why you're
by her side, isn't it?

486
00:39:07,137 --> 00:39:08,472
What do you mean, that's why?

487
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:12,184
Only until Wonjeong wakes up.
She's not Wonjeong.

488
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,394
You're right.

489
00:39:14,478 --> 00:39:18,982
Maybe she will regain her memory faster
if you're with her.

490
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:21,276
Take good care of her.

491
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,446
Why do you always say take good--

492
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:27,949
You did well.

493
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:30,577
Why are you like that
when you've done well so far?

494
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:37,209
Granny.

495
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:42,255
They know each other?

496
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:49,054
That's a suspicious combination.

497
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:58,313
I have something to ask you.

498
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:01,108
I prefer to talk elsewhere.

499
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:04,861
Follow me.

500
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:10,784
It's your first day at work,
so we should have something good.

501
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:13,745
What are you doing? Aren't you eating?

502
00:40:14,955 --> 00:40:15,956
I don't feel like eating chicken.

503
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:18,500
Is that so?

504
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,001
Then I'll have it.

505
00:40:26,675 --> 00:40:27,676
Try it.

506
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:31,179
The old lady from before,

507
00:40:32,389 --> 00:40:33,390
do you know her?

508
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:36,226
Who?

509
00:40:36,852 --> 00:40:38,812
You know? The old lady who came to school.

510
00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:40,397
Yeom-ji's grandmother.

511
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:42,899
You remember granny?

512
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:44,526
What are you talking about?

513
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,571
Never mind. Eat up.

514
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:48,655
Just try it.

515
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:51,575
Here. Try it. Come on.

516
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:53,743
With cheese.

517
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:16,349
Really?

518
00:41:21,438 --> 00:41:22,606
Okay. I understand.

519
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:26,234
Van.

520
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:28,653
Van!

521
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,201
Mi-ho!

522
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,203
-Damn it!
-Why are you in a hurry?

523
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:37,454
-You're home.
-Yes.

524
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:38,580
-I just have to--
-Wait!

525
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,207
Do you know where I've been?

526
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:42,542
I went to buy delicious shrimp croquette--

527
00:41:42,626 --> 00:41:44,419
You eat it first.

528
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,879
-Mi-ho.
-Enjoy!

529
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:49,382
Van.

530
00:41:56,473 --> 00:41:58,016
Apparently, Yoon Gyeong-jun is dead.

531
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,898
It wasn't you, was it?

532
00:42:06,483 --> 00:42:07,651
I don't kill humans.

533
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:09,903
Is that so?

534
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:13,865
Then that's a relief.

535
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,161
It feels weird.

536
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:20,538
I feel like it's a good thing,

537
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:23,667
but at the same time,
it doesn't seem right.

538
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:25,835
It shouldn't end like this.

539
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:27,837
That's what I'm thinking.

540
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:34,344
There is no conclusion
that everyone would be happy with.

541
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:36,930
You...

542
00:42:37,973 --> 00:42:39,891
really remind me of my father, you know?

543
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:44,604
There isn't a single sign of warmth.

544
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,857
You don't know how to console others,
and have no affection.

545
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:52,862
Take it.

546
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:01,705
This is called a cellphone.

547
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:05,083
Don't you know cellphones?

548
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:07,168
I know.

549
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,921
-You don't. You don't know cellphones.
-I know them.

550
00:43:12,424 --> 00:43:13,591
You know a phone, right?

551
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:15,343
How about a computer?

552
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:17,178
This thing is called a smartphone.

553
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:21,474
It combines a phone, a camera,
and a computer. It's really smart.

554
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:23,310
A hand phone.

555
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:25,645
Am I a fool?

556
00:43:25,729 --> 00:43:27,022
I know what a cellphone is.

557
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:28,982
You do?

558
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:31,234
Why don't you have one then?

559
00:43:31,318 --> 00:43:32,527
Because I don't need one.

560
00:43:34,487 --> 00:43:37,574
When you don't have it,
you don't know it's inconvenient.

561
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:39,451
But it drives the other person insane.

562
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:41,202
Because they can't get in touch.

563
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:45,040
Only take phone calls.

564
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:47,042
Just calls from me.

565
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:48,126
Every single call.

566
00:43:48,877 --> 00:43:50,003
No matter what.

567
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:08,980
Why you--

568
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:10,440
What?

569
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:12,567
I'm your boss, aren't I?

570
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:15,070
Change it if you don't like it.

571
00:44:21,451 --> 00:44:24,204
Why do I have to be intimidated by him?

572
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,039
Looking at our positions,

573
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:28,083
our roles, and our social status,

574
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:31,836
I should be the one bossing him around.

575
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,720
But I guess
my life is too vulnerable to say that.

576
00:44:53,066 --> 00:44:54,067
This is good.

577
00:45:02,534 --> 00:45:05,370
He probably never tried something
like this.

578
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:15,588
I must be mad.

579
00:45:15,672 --> 00:45:19,134
Why should I care about a prick like him?

580
00:45:20,176 --> 00:45:21,719
I should have it by myself.

581
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:24,389
I'll eat all of it.

582
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:37,694
MASTER

583
00:45:44,033 --> 00:45:45,410
Until when will you hide?

584
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:48,079
Come out.

585
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:53,084
Me?

586
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:54,627
Have I been caught?

587
00:45:56,838 --> 00:45:58,256
Damn it.

588
00:45:59,007 --> 00:46:00,550
That old man is really mean.

589
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,555
I thought I had erased my traces,

590
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:06,806
but as expected...

591
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:09,642
You have the scent of a rookie.

592
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:10,977
Sir.

593
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:13,563
It seems like you're sensitive to smell.

594
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:15,106
I...

595
00:46:16,608 --> 00:46:19,944
know what happened
between you and Wonjeong.

596
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:28,203
It's not a name
that a rookie like you can easily call.

597
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:31,831
You must be filled with guilt
just hearing Wonjeong's name, right?

598
00:46:31,915 --> 00:46:33,082
-Why you--
-But,

599
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:35,919
why are you staying closee to Mi-ho?

600
00:46:36,586 --> 00:46:38,671
One day, Mi-ho, no...

601
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:41,966
I mean, Wonjeong.

602
00:46:43,218 --> 00:46:44,219
You'll kill her.

603
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:47,180
Wait!

604
00:46:47,472 --> 00:46:48,473
Oh my.

605
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:52,018
I'm not the type to fight right way.
And it's cold today as well.

606
00:46:52,101 --> 00:46:55,438
I need to warm up my body
and muscles properly.

607
00:46:57,398 --> 00:46:58,399
Sorry.

608
00:47:05,281 --> 00:47:06,282
Okay, then.

609
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:10,370
Shall we begin now?

610
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:02,148
You're trying your tricks.

611
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:04,108
I told you before, didn't I?

612
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:06,819
You must go through a test.

613
00:49:07,737 --> 00:49:11,032
You could say it's a kind of safety check.

614
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:14,637
Van!

615
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,481
There is no boss like me.

616
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,191
I'm so caring.

617
00:50:28,693 --> 00:50:32,071
But really, where did he go?
And Johan too...

618
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:43,916
Johan.

619
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:51,507
I normally don't like doing
things this way.

620
00:50:51,799 --> 00:50:53,801
But a human fighting against a demon

621
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:55,970
is unfair to begin with, right?

622
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:02,018
But you are not really as strong
as I expected.

623
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:04,437
Yeah?

624
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:14,447
As expected,
you're definitely a lust demon.

625
00:51:17,742 --> 00:51:18,743
Be careful with that.

626
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,747
You might lose your hands if you do that.

627
00:51:32,048 --> 00:51:34,801
Saint Michael, the archangel
and leader of the heavenly army,

628
00:51:35,468 --> 00:51:37,470
by the power of God, thrust into hell

629
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:40,640
Satan and all evil spirits
who wander through the world.

630
00:51:41,808 --> 00:51:43,267
I ask in the name of the Lord.

631
00:51:45,478 --> 00:51:46,479
What is...

632
00:51:49,315 --> 00:51:50,316
your name?

633
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:58,301
Mi-ho.

634
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:01,679
Van...

635
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,180
Run...

636
00:55:55,362 --> 00:55:58,365
