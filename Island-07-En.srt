1
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:23,399
ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS DEPICTED
IN THIS SERIES ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:26,068
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED SAFELY IN
THE PRESENCE OF THEIR GUARDIANS.

3
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,276
Do you have a brother too?

4
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,613
I used to.

5
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,951
I believed there was good and evil.

6
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:04,208
That is why I stood on the side of God,
the good side.

7
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:08,838
But I killed my own brother.

8
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:15,261
When I met my brother again,

9
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:19,348
I thought my prayers
had finally been answered.

10
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:39,702
But now…

11
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:44,832
…I don't know.

12
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:52,715
Was it God's plan
or the devil's temptation?

13
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:55,676
It would be what you want to believe.

14
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,429
I think I might have known.

15
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:01,390
About my brother.

16
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:07,271
But I couldn’t believe it.

17
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,736
I denied it
because I didn’t want to believe it.

18
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,517
{\an8}Where have you been?

19
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:30,646
{\an8}Uncle.

20
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:37,403
{\an8}Get up now.

21
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:38,737
{\an8}9 YEARS AGO

22
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:23,574
Who are you?

23
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:26,702
Are you conscious now?

24
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:32,791
What have you done to us?

25
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,857
That dagger is not meant for humans.

26
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,626
Uncle.

27
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:26,595
Follow me.

28
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,923
I give my respect

29
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:08,262
to all that has happened to you
and all that you have done.

30
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:12,391
Now tell me. Who are you?

31
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:17,896
Of course. You must wonder who we are.

32
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:25,320
The place of nothingness and emptiness.

33
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:29,116
We willingly took you out of there.

34
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:31,660
What?

35
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,413
You don’t seem to believe me.

36
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:36,582
I don't blame you.

37
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,377
It has been a long time.

38
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:47,509
{\an8}ANCIENT TAMRA

39
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:56,310
I will kill you right here if you refuse.

40
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:32,971
You must tame it, or else--

41
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:34,139
Stop it!

42
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,810
Please stop it.

43
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:44,066
Would you do it, then?

44
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:23,230
You have been chosen by the Geumgangjeo!

45
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,417
Gungtan and Van!

46
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:29,713
The Geumgangjeo is now yours!

47
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:35,844
Use that weapon to kill lust demons.
Your mission is to kill.

48
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:40,140
In doing so,
save Tamra and the world from chaos!

49
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:44,644
That is your calling,
the reason for your survival.

50
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,516
Get up. Try again.

51
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:26,436
I cannot do it.

52
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:31,900
I said everyone dies if you were to quit.
Are you sure you can live with that?

53
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:36,655
Again!

54
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:55,048
How was today’s training?

55
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:57,592
I am sure it will get better.

56
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,847
Are they demon slayers?

57
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,224
Yes, they are.

58
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:22,659
-Let’s call it a day. Take them back.
-Yes.

59
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:18,507
I am Wonjeong.

60
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:30,101
Eat them. They are delicious.

61
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:40,278
I will come again.

62
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:17,023
Slow down. I will bring some more.

63
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:50,223
Why do those boys have the energy
of lust demons?

64
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:54,811
-They are demon slayers.
-Demon slayers?

65
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:58,064
You mean they are monks
whose only mission is to kill?

66
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:04,404
They have devoted their bodies and souls
to killing lust demons.

67
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:09,409
Those children will grow up
to save many lives from harm.

68
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:13,371
Was it out of their own free will?

69
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:20,337
I can't believe this. Did you force them
to become demon slayers?

70
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,174
Neither the order nor humans
are supposed to do this.

71
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:27,719
Are you saying
you're fine if this land becomes hell?

72
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:32,807
You are forcing them to kill.

73
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:36,728
Why do you make them commit such sins?

74
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,689
Think about how much they'd suffer.

75
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,442
They don't know what suffering is.

76
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,779
What do you mean
they don’t know what suffering is?

77
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:49,991
I have erased all human emotions
from them.

78
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:56,539
So they don’t know
what joy, sorrow, anger, or guilt are.

79
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,627
They don’t feel these sufferings

80
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:04,464
because the only reason they exist
is to kill lust demons.

81
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:07,384
You are still very young,

82
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:10,470
so I may seem like a demon to you.

83
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:15,934
But until a barrier is created again
and lust demons are sealed,

84
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:19,104
the only ones that can protect humans

85
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:22,065
are those demon slayers
that I created myself.

86
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:30,657
If you could create a barrier right now,
there would be no need for demon slayers.

87
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:34,035
But that is not possible, is it?

88
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,707
Now go.

89
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:22,959
I am sorry.

90
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:27,422
Don't worry.
I just need to put some herbs on it.

91
00:17:58,578 --> 00:17:59,871
Wonjeong!

92
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,047
-What's wrong?
-It's my fault.

93
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,967
-Let's leave her here.
-No way!

94
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:16,846
We have to run away, or we will die.

95
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:20,642
Wonjeong.

96
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:31,486
I knew Wonjeong was more caught up
in personal feelings than the great cause.

97
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:35,365
-But I didn't think she'd do this…
-Van has returned!

98
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:52,090
Bring Wonjeong inside!

99
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,307
Van, how dare you!

100
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:04,978
Let go! Let go of me.

101
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:07,230
Let go!

102
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,524
Let me go!

103
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,652
How dare you!

104
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:17,574
Wonjeong showed some compassion.
That doesn't mean you are humans.

105
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,327
You can never get out of here.

106
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:24,205
You will go to hell

107
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:27,750
if you abandon the bodhisattva’s path
of killing lust demons!

108
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:31,546
Do you want to live in the lowest hell
for eternity?

109
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:32,630
Hell

110
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:34,549
is right here.

111
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,885
Drag them away!

112
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,105
Where…

113
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:54,903
You passed out.
That demon slayer, Van, carried you here.

114
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:57,030
That means, those boys…

115
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:02,869
What will happen to them?

116
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:08,082
-They will probably be beaten to death.
-No!

117
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,251
Didn't you expect this would happen?

118
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,796
They are going through such pain
because of you.

119
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:18,760
Look at the consequences of running away
from your destiny!

120
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:22,013
I told you about the Law of Causality.

121
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:26,476
Action always leads to consequences.

122
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:32,106
Those boys wouldn't have been punished
if it weren't for you.

123
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:37,946
If I create a barrier,

124
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,741
what will be the consequence of that?

125
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:50,667
If I accept my destiny

126
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:54,629
and possess the power to create a barrier…

127
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,800
…will they be spared?

128
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:07,058
Yes, if you have that power,

129
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:11,062
you might be able to save those boys.

130
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:18,361
All right. That's all I want.

131
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,532
{\an8}15 YEARS LATER

132
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:37,547
Please…

133
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:59,212
-Why did you do that?
-Do what?

134
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:05,176
Why did you kill those people?
They weren't even lust demons.

135
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:09,972
Did I really?

136
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:21,442
Van!

137
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:34,831
It's been a while.

138
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:45,341
I am overwhelmed to see you have grown-up

139
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:50,012
and to hear you have gained the power
to create a barrier.

140
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:52,390
Jongryeong.

141
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:57,228
Once I create a new barrier,

142
00:23:57,311 --> 00:24:00,356
lust demons will no longer appear
in this world.

143
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:06,737
So please set Van and Gungtan free
after I create the barrier.

144
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:15,204
Let them live the rest of their lives
like humans, please.

145
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:38,895
What happened?

146
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,689
I brought good news.

147
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:49,071
After the full moon,
I'll create a new barrier on this island.

148
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:51,157
After that,

149
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,869
you will be set free.

150
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:57,246
Jongryeong approved as well.

151
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:00,374
Are you sure?

152
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:05,004
When that time comes, Van, Gungtan,

153
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:08,174
you won't need to kill anymore.

154
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:14,096
Van.

155
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,017
Do you trust Wonjeong?

156
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,604
Does it matter whether I trust her?

157
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,356
I don't trust her.

158
00:25:27,777 --> 00:25:29,403
You are still too naive.

159
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:33,199
Humans have deceived us,
turned us into monsters,

160
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:34,700
and used us as hounds.

161
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:36,410
Wonjeong?

162
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:41,165
She can't accept the blood
of lust demons that flows inside us.

163
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:49,548
Once they get rid of all the lust demons
after Wonjeong creates a barrier,

164
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:52,635
we will become hounds
that no longer need to hunt.

165
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:55,513
Do you think they'll just let us go?

166
00:25:57,098 --> 00:25:59,892
I'm sure they will get rid of us
like the other lust demons.

167
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:01,602
If it comes to that situation,

168
00:26:05,106 --> 00:26:07,400
Wonjeong will not just sit back.

169
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:09,902
After all, she is on their side.

170
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:16,367
So, we have to strike
before they attack us.

171
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,453
The two of us can do it.

172
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:24,083
No matter what we do,
we will never become humans.

173
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:29,171
I just want one thing.

174
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:36,846
I want to feel human emotions
even if it is just for one moment.

175
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:11,172
Follow me.

176
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,519
I appreciate what you have done so far.

177
00:28:07,061 --> 00:28:11,649
While Wonjeong creates a barrier tonight,

178
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:16,862
we will perform a ritual
to purify your bodies and souls.

179
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:23,160
You should follow the ritual
with a sense of reverence.

180
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:46,809
Remove the cover.

181
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,021
Set it on fire.

182
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,411
Open the door right now!

183
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:15,129
When Wonjeong completes the barrier,

184
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:18,424
evil will disappear from this world.

185
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:22,011
You have the energy of lust demons.

186
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:26,432
I cannot let you exist
in the purified world.

187
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,977
So you should rest now.

188
00:29:30,478 --> 00:29:31,979
What do you mean?

189
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:34,315
This is for everyone.

190
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:38,944
Jongryeong, you must have got it wrong.

191
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:41,530
Wonjeong would not have let this happen!

192
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:44,074
She knows about this.

193
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:46,410
Only you fools didn't know.

194
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:52,958
I knew it,
I should not have trusted humans.

195
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:57,963
Even parents
or Wonjeong who promised to protect us.

196
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:00,508
All humans are the same.

197
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:04,637
Your parents?
You mean the parents whom you killed?

198
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:08,349
Did you think I wouldn't know?

199
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:10,559
I know everything.

200
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:15,022
You kill people for fun
even though they are not lust demons.

201
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:17,858
You should be removed from this world!

202
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:19,652
I will rip you off first!

203
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:26,408
This is my punishment to you.

204
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:30,120
Jongryeong!

205
00:30:30,204 --> 00:30:34,792
I need to hear from Wonjeong herself.
There's no way she agreed to this!

206
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:46,387
I'm not going to die that easily!

207
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:03,380
No way. I sealed it tightly.

208
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:05,215
How could this happen?

209
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:54,283
Forgive us.

210
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:58,245
<i>Van!</i>

211
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:00,914
<i>Wonjeong.</i>

212
00:34:05,753 --> 00:34:07,254
I knew this would happen.

213
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:10,883
You beasts!

214
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:15,512
You will go to hell.

215
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:59,348
This is my punishment to you.

216
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:06,355
Wonjeong, do not stop. You must continue.

217
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:11,026
I should go down, Baek-ju.

218
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,779
We are running out of time.

219
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:16,281
Lust demons are swarming out.

220
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,958
Create the barrier. Hurry!

221
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:47,771
If you don't do it now,

222
00:35:47,855 --> 00:35:53,527
not a single creature will survive
on this Tamra or even across the sea.

223
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,237
Everyone will end up dying.

224
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,532
So you must hurry
and seal lust demons under the ground.

225
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:00,617
Van turned into a lust demon.

226
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,872
If I set up the barrier now,

227
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:08,625
he will be sealed as well.

228
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:15,841
It is already too late.
He can't be turned back into a human.

229
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:30,606
What happened?

230
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:37,946
Wonjeong.

231
00:36:39,156 --> 00:36:40,741
Were you really going to kill us?

232
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:45,787
How about your promise? Did you lie to us?

233
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:25,494
You still haven't killed Wonjeong.

234
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:27,788
You fool.

235
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:49,017
Wonjeong, you must save Tamra.

236
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:52,688
Baek-ju, I promised

237
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:56,024
that I will save Van and Gungtan.

238
00:37:56,942 --> 00:37:59,945
I cannot…

239
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:03,448
I cannot abandon them.

240
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:22,551
Is this your choice, my brother?

241
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,471
Wonjeong didn't know.

242
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:30,225
It doesn't matter now.

243
00:39:02,466 --> 00:39:03,842
Stop it now.

244
00:39:05,886 --> 00:39:08,722
Let's go together, both of you.

245
00:39:10,891 --> 00:39:15,896
All the sins, karma, injustice,
and torment that you have committed,

246
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:21,610
I will help you redeem them
in your next life.

247
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:45,509
Sins and karma?

248
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:52,891
It's not me or Van
who should be condemned.

249
00:40:48,238 --> 00:40:51,575
Wonjeong.

250
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,500
It's all over now.

251
00:41:00,584 --> 00:41:01,918
Wonjeong.

252
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:09,217
I wanted to get you out of this hell.

253
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:13,346
You cannot die.

254
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:17,684
Promise me, Van.

255
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:24,608
I will come back to save you.

256
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:26,610
Wait until then.

257
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:30,906
No, Wonjeong.

258
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:32,991
You cannot die yet.

259
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:36,453
When I come back,

260
00:41:38,872 --> 00:41:41,833
you must recognize me.

261
00:41:45,629 --> 00:41:46,880
Don't forget me, Van.

262
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:52,928
I will save you again. I promise.

263
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:40,905
