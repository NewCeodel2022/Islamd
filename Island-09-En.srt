1
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:23,482
ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS DEPICTED
IN THIS SERIES ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:26,068
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED SAFELY
IN THE PRESENCE OF THEIR GUARDIANS.

3
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:27,815
Who the hell is this bummer?

4
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:29,984
Damn it.

5
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:33,320
Like mother, like daughter. You bitches.

6
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:35,739
Move it!

7
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:38,284
Damn it.

8
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:45,374
Mom!

9
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:49,587
Mom.

10
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:57,386
Eyes down.

11
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:01,432
Lower your eyes.

12
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:06,520
Lower your goddamn eyes!

13
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:13,652
You possessed bitch,

14
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:16,697
you have ruined our family.

15
00:03:17,323 --> 00:03:18,324
Damn it!

16
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:44,642
Stab me.

17
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:48,270
Go on.

18
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:51,315
Do it!

19
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:55,527
Stab me, damn it!

20
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,247
Do you regret it?

21
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:14,964
In that case…

22
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,312
Mom.

23
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:32,189
Mom.

24
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:34,942
Mom.

25
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:39,655
Mom.

26
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,452
Mom.

27
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,075
What is your name?

28
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:28,620
Yeom-ji.

29
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:20,589
{\an8}Did you go to Jongryeong, after all?

30
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,219
{\an8}So? Did you find answers?

31
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:32,643
{\an8}I'm sure it also pains Jongryeong
to raise those boys as demon slayers.

32
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:39,483
The mission of Taejang Buddhism
is to protect this land and the barrier.

33
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:43,028
He has taken a desperate measure
knowing it was a sin.

34
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:44,571
Don’t blame him too much.

35
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:50,327
I feel… sorry for them.

36
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,664
Unfortunately,

37
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,249
that is their karma.

38
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,752
They wouldn't have wanted
to carry that karma.

39
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:02,381
Why?

40
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:06,093
With them being tied up, do you feel like
your situations are alike?

41
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,267
Wonjeong.

42
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,813
Come here.

43
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:29,741
My oh my, you poor thing.

44
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:33,453
If you had been born an average girl,

45
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:40,460
you wouldn't have needed to know
about this hard practice or the barrier.

46
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:49,553
However, that is also the destiny
that you have to fulfil.

47
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,099
I still don't know

48
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,937
if I really have the power
to create a barrier.

49
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,734
Even if I have it,
how do I awaken that power?

50
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:12,409
I wish I could just forget
about fulfilling my destiny.

51
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:19,416
I wish I could do it in your place.

52
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:11,653
Wait…

53
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,288
This energy is…

54
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:24,416
Why? What?

55
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,209
Why?

56
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:46,933
Mi-ho.

57
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,661
Mi-ho.

58
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,371
Hold on.

59
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:10,165
There's something here…

60
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:43,615
<i>I will</i>

61
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:45,617
be back to save you, no matter what.

62
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:51,206
Please wait for me.

63
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:53,500
I promise you.

64
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,352
Promise me, Van.

65
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:18,984
I will come back to save you.

66
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,278
Wait until then.

67
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,256
I had a flashback.

68
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:43,049
Did you see your memory?

69
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,220
Yes, just a glimpse.

70
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:55,562
What did you see?

71
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:38,355
<i>How pathetic.</i>
<i>This fear still remains in me.</i>

72
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:12,263
Granny, what's wrong?

73
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,513
Don't get up.

74
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,066
Gungtan.

75
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:07,902
It was him, wasn't it?

76
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:11,573
You're right.

77
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,617
He became an evil spirit

78
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,037
because of his deep-seated resentment.

79
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:24,377
Van, we don't have time.

80
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,213
So…

81
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:32,302
don't give her your affection.

82
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,096
Don't you know

83
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,558
that she has to live as Wonjeong
once she gets her memory back?

84
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:43,813
Shells disappear
when their original self returns.

85
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:48,151
Take back your affection
even if you already gave it to her.

86
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,127
How is she? Is she all right?

87
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:07,253
Is she okay?

88
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,799
Everyone, get out now.

89
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:13,468
Don’t you dare come back.

90
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,150
-Mi-ho, let me take these.
-Okay.

91
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:35,156
-Shall I put them in your room?
-In front of it, please.

92
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:45,917
I’ll get going first.

93
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:00,807
Training might be tough for a while.
Stay in the villa.

94
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:05,103
-What’s wrong?
-There’s too much lust-demon energy--

95
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:06,396
That’s not what I mean.

96
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:12,235
Why aren’t you looking at me?

97
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:20,994
Happy now?

98
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:24,622
I won’t come for a while.

99
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,834
-I need to know where they're spread out--
-Got it.

100
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:31,462
Do what you need to do.

101
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:55,820
<i>Don't give her your affection.</i>

102
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:02,030
Su-ryeon.

103
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:06,075
Please, no. Don't.

104
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:08,536
Su-ryeon.

105
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:32,268
Su-ryeon!

106
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:50,870
It seems

107
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:54,457
that you're sorry you lost your friend.

108
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,544
But why Su-ryeon, of all people?

109
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:04,300
Because she was special.

110
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,939
Let’s go now, child.

111
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:30,451
All right.

112
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:25,339
Mi-ho!

113
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:33,181
-Where are you going?
-School.

114
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:35,433
I've been absent for too long.

115
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:37,268
You shouldn’t go alone.

116
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:40,938
Just a second. I'll just get changed.

117
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:44,400
-I’ll be right back!
-Take your time!

118
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:58,247
-What do you want to eat?
-For lunch?

119
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,712
Hey, it's blood!

120
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:07,673
Excuse me.

121
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:23,606
Hang on, Mi-ho. Hang on.

122
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,483
-Step aside.
-Hold on.

123
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:27,526
Out of the way.

124
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:50,258
Su-ryeon…

125
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:53,886
Su-ryeon.

126
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,180
Su-ryeon!

127
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:58,266
Oh no!

128
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:00,017
Oh no!

129
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:02,478
Oh my God!

130
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:07,149
No, Su-ryeon! No!

131
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:10,319
<i>Next up is a report of an accident.</i>

132
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:13,239
<i>At a downtown high school</i>
<i>last night, a girl…</i>

133
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:15,324
{\an8}HIGH-SCHOOL GIRL SUICIDE
RAPE, SPY CAM THREATS

134
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:17,451
<i>…killed herself</i>
<i>by jumping off the rooftop.</i>

135
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:19,620
<i>She was quiet and introverted…</i>

136
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,264
Where have you been?

137
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:44,729
-Su-ryeon died.
-I know.

138
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,483
Su-ryeon was finally getting better.

139
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:52,611
She was finally…

140
00:26:55,573 --> 00:26:57,158
beginning to smile.

141
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:07,793
But now look.

142
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:11,756
It's my fault.

143
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:23,559
I'm so furious that I'm losing my mind.

144
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:28,481
There's nothing I can do
apart from trying to stay alive.

145
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:31,108
I'm so angry at myself
and at this situation.

146
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:36,280
I didn't want to lose anyone anymore.

147
00:27:36,364 --> 00:27:38,115
That's why I started this.

148
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:44,538
Why isn't the power awakening? Huh?

149
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:49,043
Why the hell
did that little girl have to die?

150
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:50,211
Why?

151
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:56,092
I want to quit everything.

152
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:58,969
I really want to stop it all.

153
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,151
If it's too hard, you can stop.

154
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,237
Stop and leave.

155
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:42,638
If I leave, then what about you?

156
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:00,531
Did you already forget what I am?

157
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:06,454
I'm a lust demon that kills lust demons,
nothing more, nothing less.

158
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,707
There's nothing you can do
for me, a non-human.

159
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:57,314
Mi-ho.

160
00:30:58,107 --> 00:31:00,818
-Where are you going?
-You know as well.

161
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:03,195
Su-ryeon isn't the type
who'd commit suicide.

162
00:31:05,656 --> 00:31:06,824
I'm going to school.

163
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:09,159
I'll find surveillance tapes, witnesses,

164
00:31:09,243 --> 00:31:11,620
whatever it takes
to prove it was a homicide.

165
00:31:11,704 --> 00:31:13,038
Mi-ho.

166
00:31:13,414 --> 00:31:16,417
It's dangerous out there. You know that.

167
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,003
Johan.

168
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:23,007
Every time I run away…

169
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,011
…people die.

170
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:33,017
I no longer want that.

171
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:36,103
Mi-ho. Mi-ho!

172
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:41,525
Mi-ho! Mi-ho!

173
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,113
Where is she going?

174
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:47,990
Please drive, Father.

175
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:05,924
Speed up, Father.

176
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,035
Secretary Kang.

177
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:36,872
You are the reason I died.

178
00:32:41,377 --> 00:32:44,004
You have ruined everything,

179
00:32:44,088 --> 00:32:46,340
including myself and Su-jin.

180
00:32:47,383 --> 00:32:48,509
It's all because of you.

181
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:50,761
Seung-joon.

182
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:57,142
-Gusunsae?
-That's right.

183
00:32:57,726 --> 00:33:02,231
Gusunsae. He uncovers the dark side
in people's minds.

184
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:08,404
Please save me.

185
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:10,823
Please save me.

186
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:12,366
When you meet with Gusunsae,

187
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:15,411
you struggle inside your own hell.

188
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:18,247
<i>And you end up taking your own life.</i>

189
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:21,667
Miss Won. Help!

190
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:24,628
How's that possible?

191
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:29,883
<i>Watch carefully what Gusunsae does.</i>

192
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:33,595
Then, could we kill Miss Won this time?

193
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:35,806
Miss.

194
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:39,685
It's all my fault.

195
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:45,733
They all died because of me.

196
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:48,402
Su-ryeon died because of me.

197
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:50,571
Secretary Kang died because of me.

198
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:54,324
Seung-joon and Su-jin
died because of me as well.

199
00:33:58,662 --> 00:33:59,788
Are you okay?

200
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:06,920
Mi-ho, take it slow.

201
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:18,390
Hey, what's wrong with you?
Get back down, now.

202
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:19,600
Father.

203
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:22,561
Just a moment.

204
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:32,029
-Grab her!
-Hey!

205
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:35,532
-Hurry and grab her!
-Hey!

206
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:42,039
<i>In the name of the Lord</i>
<i>and of the Holy Spirit…</i>

207
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,003
That's it!

208
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:09,358
Please help me, Father.

209
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:22,204
-Will it work?
-We must make it work.

210
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:30,212
<i>In the name of the Father, and of the Son,</i>
<i>and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</i>

211
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:34,299
-I'll leave this to you, then.
-Sure.

212
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:45,519
<i>Saint Michael the Archangel,</i>

213
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:48,856
<i>defend us in battle.</i>

214
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:55,445
<i>Be our protection against the wickedness</i>
<i>and snares of the devil.</i>

215
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:58,699
<i>May God rebuke him.</i>

216
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:02,870
<i>Our Father who art in heaven,</i>

217
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:08,417
<i>Thy kingdom come.</i>

218
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:11,920
<i>Thy will be done,</i>

219
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:16,383
<i>on earth as it is in heaven.</i>

220
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:21,513
<i>Give us this day our daily bread.</i>

221
00:36:21,597 --> 00:36:24,975
<i>And forgive us our trespasses,</i>

222
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:29,897
<i>as we forgive those</i>
<i>who trespass against us…</i>

223
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,481
He's going to the playground.

224
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:34,318
He's not like the other lust demons.

225
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:37,321
-Van.
-Follow me.

226
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:45,120
Go.

227
00:36:47,748 --> 00:36:50,208
You're an exorcist. Don't overthink it.

228
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:03,889
<i>Almighty and eternal God,</i>
<i>we humbly beseech Thee,</i>

229
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:07,225
<i>to bless and sanctify this water.</i>

230
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:32,250
Hold on. No!

231
00:37:59,236 --> 00:38:03,115
<i>Renew us through the grace of the Lord</i>
<i>and baptism, the fountain of life.</i>

232
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:05,534
<i>Protect us</i>
<i>from all the evil spirits in the world.</i>

233
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,077
<i>May our souls be washed.</i>

234
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,788
<i>Grant us the grace of salvation.</i>

235
00:38:11,999 --> 00:38:13,000
<i>Amen.</i>

236
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:59,296
Uncle. What took you so long?

237
00:39:00,047 --> 00:39:01,214
What about Miss Won?

238
00:39:01,298 --> 00:39:04,634
Did it go as planned? Say something.

239
00:39:10,307 --> 00:39:13,310
Thanks to you, we got her spot on.

240
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,938
I have to disappear to end this situation.

241
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:18,774
Everyone has died because of me.

242
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,942
It's all because of me.

243
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:22,569
So you must kill me.

244
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:25,197
I have to die.

245
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:28,867
It's thanks to me?

246
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:32,704
Your friend.

247
00:39:33,747 --> 00:39:36,124
Won Mi-ho must've cared a lot about her.

248
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:48,345
How about you just do it yourself?

249
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:53,809
Instead of conjuring lust demons up,

250
00:39:55,602 --> 00:39:59,356
isn't killing Won Mi-ho yourself
faster and simpler?

251
00:40:05,654 --> 00:40:09,574
What a load of nonsense.

252
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,999
It's getting late. Granny will worry.

253
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,001
I'll get going.

254
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:24,172
Child.

255
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:33,473
Where's the next Hareubang?

256
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:36,309
I don't know yet.

257
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:38,812
Hurry up.

258
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:42,524
I would have to ask Granny myself
if you don't.

259
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,361
Sure.

260
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:10,260
<i>Hurry up. I would have to ask</i>
<i>Granny myself if you don't.</i>

261
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:12,971
Granny!

262
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:18,101
Where were you out so late?

263
00:41:18,185 --> 00:41:20,896
Why did you come out? You're not well.

264
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:24,566
You're so tiny.
I was afraid a crow would carry you away.

265
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:31,865
When you came to me,

266
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:36,161
were you about 13 years old?

267
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:39,539
I was 13. It was winter.
The day of the first snow.

268
00:41:40,749 --> 00:41:42,584
Why'd you suddenly talk about the past?

269
00:41:44,044 --> 00:41:47,255
I've been thinking about those days
a lot lately.

270
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:54,512
-This is your favorite, Yeom-ji.
-Yes.

271
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,066
Wow, you make it look so delicious.

272
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:08,276
This looks good.

273
00:42:09,486 --> 00:42:12,239
-The spring breeze--
-My goodness!

274
00:42:12,322 --> 00:42:14,950
-Oh dear, look at my Yeom-ji.
-Oh my.

275
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:17,410
<i>You were just a kid</i>
<i>but you were quick-witted</i>

276
00:42:17,494 --> 00:42:20,538
<i>and so skillful and thorough.</i>

277
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:22,916
<i>Thanks to you, I've lived well for years,</i>

278
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:27,003
<i>never having a moment to feel lonely.</i>

279
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:34,469
<i>I knew you were a bird that was passing by</i>
<i>to rest under my shadow,</i>

280
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:40,225
<i>but I wished you'd consider here your nest</i>
<i>and come back.</i>

281
00:42:42,644 --> 00:42:44,479
What's gotten into you tonight, Granny?

282
00:42:45,522 --> 00:42:47,732
I had a bad dream.

283
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:53,947
Do you know why I took you in?

284
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:58,910
The scent of mountains,
the scent of oceans, the scent of trees…

285
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:04,499
Even a small stone has its unique scent.

286
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:10,547
I wanted to help you find your own scent.

287
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,843
Somehow I had the feeling

288
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:19,389
that you would give off the scent
of dazzling sunlight.

289
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:23,852
You must've had one hell of a bad dream.

290
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:25,854
Let's go already. I'm hungry.

291
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:26,938
All right.

292
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:30,317
I'll always prepare you a fresh warm meal.

293
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:33,653
Just come back
no matter where you are going.

294
00:43:35,155 --> 00:43:36,364
That's all I ask.

295
