1
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,357
ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS DEPICTED
IN THIS SERIES ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:23,441 --> 00:00:25,317
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED SAFELY IN
THE PRESENCE OF THEIR GUARDIANS.

3
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,297
Everyone is at worship.

4
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,049
If we run away now, nobody would know.

5
00:01:08,194 --> 00:01:09,195
Were you scared?

6
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:13,532
The world outside is big and bright.

7
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:16,619
No one will lock you up.

8
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:22,958
You can run freely
and go wherever you want.

9
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:26,212
Let's leave quickly.
This will be our only chance.

10
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,781
Van!

11
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:35,573
Wonjeong!

12
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:38,909
Wonjeong.

13
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:42,413
Because of me…

14
00:02:55,634 --> 00:03:02,266
I knew Wonjeong was more caught up
in personal feelings than a great cause.

15
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,728
-But I didn't think she'd do this…
-Van has returned!

16
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:22,494
Bring Wonjeong inside!

17
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:26,707
Let go of me!

18
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:28,250
Let go!

19
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:31,629
Let go! I said, "Let go of me!"

20
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:08,582
Are you okay?

21
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:11,627
It's all my fault.

22
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,488
I'm sorry. It was my fault.

23
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:52,167
I'm going to leave now.

24
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,546
I came to say my last goodbye.

25
00:04:56,797 --> 00:05:00,342
To break the barrier, I must train.

26
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,268
And after that, I'm going to save you two.

27
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:12,062
So until then…

28
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,983
make sure you survive.

29
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,864
Hang in there,
even if you don't want to live.

30
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:25,284
Can you promise?

31
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,121
Are you going to come back?

32
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:34,084
I'll be back to save you, no matter what.

33
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,009
Please wait for me.

34
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,641
I promise you.

35
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:12,933
Father?

36
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:16,937
My apologies.

37
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,775
To be honest, I didn't expect the exorcist
sent by the diocese to be Korean…

38
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:26,488
And I also didn't expect you
to be this young.

39
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,241
If I offended you, I apologize.

40
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:30,701
It's fine.

41
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,537
How long has it been
since you were last in Korea?

42
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:35,789
About ten years.

43
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,875
I left Korea when I was ten.

44
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:43,088
But it doesn't feel unfamiliar.
It actually feels like I've missed it.

45
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,632
You speak Korean very well.

46
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:48,594
I really like K-pop and K-drama.

47
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:50,220
That helped a lot.

48
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,057
Right.

49
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:57,686
We've met for the first time,
so I'm not sure if it's okay to say this,

50
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:00,856
but your achievements
are quite astonishing.

51
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:03,942
No, not at all.

52
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:08,822
One of your finest achievements
was the exorcism performed

53
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:11,366
in Detroit, USA, in 2017, right?

54
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,869
It was in 2018.
The Face of Devil incident.

55
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,830
You were just 17 back then.

56
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:18,707
I was just lucky.

57
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,293
Last year, in Olite, Spain,

58
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:25,964
I heard you single-handedly exorcised
a devil worshipper.

59
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:29,843
It took me just three minutes.
But I caused a lot of trouble for others.

60
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:33,263
Because my spiritual aim was a bit off.

61
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:35,682
Aren't you being too humble?

62
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:37,184
I'm nothing.

63
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,770
From what I've heard, you were devoted

64
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,940
to serving only a single vocation
for your entire life.

65
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:45,484
Protect

66
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,361
the savior.

67
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,740
I think you're being too wary.

68
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:54,743
I'm not too sure what you mean.

69
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,078
Father, you know too, right?

70
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,705
The existence of the prophecy.

71
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:03,168
According to the prophecy,

72
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,964
the moment when evil
was about to devour the world,

73
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:13,053
the only savior who could prevent
the destruction of the world appeared.

74
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:18,976
However, unfortunately,
she was not able to fulfill her mission.

75
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:24,273
But the problem is that the world is again
in the danger of being devoured by evil.

76
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:26,733
Once more,

77
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:28,944
the darkness may cover the world.

78
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,363
With all of this explained,

79
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,782
it is quite clear that Won Mi-ho

80
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:36,910
is the one vocation
and savior you've been protecting.

81
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:39,913
You must know it the best.

82
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:42,457
What are you planning to do?

83
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,084
What would I do?

84
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,254
Simply, I'll protect

85
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:49,589
and awaken.

86
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:52,759
It won't be easy,

87
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,054
either protecting or awakening.

88
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:59,891
Come on, you acknowledge me earlier.

89
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,811
And I'm more capable than you might think.

90
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,818
I tried to search for things
in the prophecy too.

91
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,486
But I couldn't find them.

92
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,906
That's why I'm trying
to see it for myself.

93
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:19,828
I'll try to introduce you as my nephew
to Miss Mi-ho, not too far from now.

94
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:21,330
Sure.

95
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,291
I can't wait to meet Won Mi-ho.

96
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:30,630
As well as the man in the dark
from the prophecy.

97
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:39,014
Yes, Miss.

98
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,267
Can you send a car to where I am, Mister?

99
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:45,354
Miss?

100
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:48,231
I've followed along Bijarim-ro.

101
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,360
Please come quickly, okay?

102
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:52,986
Miss.

103
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,238
Miss?

104
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:14,961
Who are you?

105
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,101
Don't escape from here.

106
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:33,688
That's how you can survive.

107
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:45,825
Miss!

108
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:47,619
Miss!

109
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,037
-Mister.
-Are you okay?

110
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:00,757
So…

111
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,510
you saw a murderer?

112
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,846
Yes. How many times do I have to tell you?

113
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:11,309
Secretary Kang changed into a monster.

114
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:13,770
And that psychopath… I mean, the devil

115
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:15,689
killed Secretary Kang

116
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:17,732
cutting him into pieces like this.

117
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,068
A monster…

118
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:21,861
and a devil?

119
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:23,154
As well as dismemberment?

120
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,867
I know it's hard to believe.

121
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:32,914
Despite knowing it's hard to believe,
the fact that I'm saying these…

122
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,459
I must sound crazy, right?

123
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,129
I'm the only crazy one here.

124
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:40,797
Right?

125
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,881
Miss.

126
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,883
You believe what I'm saying, right?

127
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,177
Yes, I believe you. Amen.

128
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:51,308
Never mind that.
Tell my Dad to send me a private jet.

129
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:53,560
I can't stay here any longer.

130
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,687
-I'm going to Seoul right away.
-Miss.

131
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,230
Calm down--

132
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:59,024
How can I calm down?

133
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:01,526
When I've witnessed
a person be cut down into pieces?

134
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,403
If you go and wait in the car,

135
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:06,448
I'll give the president a call.

136
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,247
I don't think Ms. Won Mi-ho is sane.

137
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,919
Does she take narcotics?

138
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:21,004
Of course not.

139
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,342
If necessary, we'll come
to the police station for questioning.

140
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,219
No, you don't have to do that.

141
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:31,931
Only daughter of Daehan Group.

142
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,103
Must be a headache.

143
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:43,193
Miss?

144
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,282
WON TAE-HAN, PRESIDENT

145
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:51,618
Yes, sir.

146
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,414
She must've been really tired.

147
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,793
I think she went to bed early.

148
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:04,339
As it's her first time coming
to an unfamiliar place,

149
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,758
it seems like she needs some time
to settle in.

150
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:09,052
Yes, sir.

151
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:13,473
I'll make sure to watch out for her.

152
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,773
I wouldn't believe what I said either.

153
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:30,740
Yes, where are you?

154
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,535
<i>That address is not on the map.</i>

155
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:37,872
Are you at the cliff I told you about?

156
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,165
<i>Yes.</i>

157
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:41,918
That's fine then. I'm on my way down now.

158
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,462
<i>-Where are you going?</i>
-To the airport.

159
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:10,363
JEJU INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

160
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,490
Could you just pull over right there?

161
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,140
It's an airport
and they don't even fix the lights.

162
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,102
Huh?

163
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:42,604
What's this?

164
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:44,147
It's moving.

165
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,455
A business seat to Seoul.

166
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:03,500
Actually, just give me
whatever is available.

167
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:06,044
Yes, Ma'am. May I see your identification?

168
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,381
IDENTIFICATION CARD
WON MI-HO

169
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:13,718
Ma'am, please wait a moment.

170
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,094
What's wrong?

171
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:19,891
Ms. Won Mi-ho is here.

172
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:24,312
I'm sorry, but could you please hurry?
I think I'll miss the flight.

173
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:25,855
Yes, I understand.

174
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:29,651
Ma'am, please wait a moment.

175
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,319
What's the matter?

176
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:39,118
Someone from above
asked you to wait a moment.

177
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:40,203
Who from above?

178
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:44,082
I'm not too sure,
but please wait a little--

179
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:48,378
Call the person from above
so I can speak to them. Call them.

180
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:49,504
I'm really sorry, Ma'am.

181
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:51,881
Forget the apology,
I'm going to miss the flight.

182
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,633
Please wait a little longer.

183
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:55,218
-Instead of waiting, call--
-Ms. Won Mi-ho!

184
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,639
Ms. Won Mi-ho?

185
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:02,392
Please come with me for a moment.

186
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:04,727
Why?

187
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:08,481
Okay, we're almost there.

188
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:16,948
This way, please.

189
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:32,881
Hello? Ms. Won Mi-ho is here--

190
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,594
Yes. Understood.

191
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:48,479
I'm sorry, but I've been ordered
to protect you.

192
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:52,233
You have to wait here
until someone comes to pick you up.

193
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,694
What did you say? Ordered to protect me?

194
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:57,530
I've only been given the order as well.

195
00:19:58,281 --> 00:20:00,074
Let's just wait and see.

196
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,160
What do you mean wait? I'm must go now.

197
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:03,912
Hey, one second.

198
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:08,541
I'm sure you have your reasons,
but we have to follow the procedures.

199
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,793
I hope you understand.

200
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:14,714
Please take a seat.

201
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:34,233
Are you really
<i>the </i>Ms. Won Mi-ho of Daehan Group?

202
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:41,991
I did read an article
about you coming to Jeju Island.

203
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:45,578
But you are really beautiful in person!

204
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,122
My apologies.

205
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:50,875
Sorry, but can we take a picture--

206
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:51,960
Look.

207
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,587
Do I look like I'm in the mood
to take a picture?

208
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:56,339
I'm going to miss my flight!

209
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:57,757
I'm sorry.

210
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:08,851
Hey, punk! You said you're just going
to the toilet. What took you so long?

211
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:10,812
Why are your hands black?

212
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,526
Go finish the overdue task log.

213
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:18,987
I'm sorry. Where were we?

214
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,071
Oh! Pictures!

215
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:23,658
I have seen many celebrities,

216
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,703
but I've never asked for pictures--

217
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,167
What the hell!

218
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:34,919
What are you doing now?

219
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:38,297
Hey, punk! What are you doing?

220
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:42,176
I said what are you doing?

221
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,610
Don't! Don't come!

222
00:21:59,694 --> 00:22:02,071
No! Don't come near me!

223
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:34,854
I told you I'll give you the money.

224
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,565
How many times did I tell you?
My kid is unwell.

225
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:38,858
Huh?

226
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:41,652
Hey!

227
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:43,738
Didn't I say I'll give you the money?

228
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:46,741
Oh, who is this?

229
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:48,367
Shit! Get out!

230
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,620
Get out! Who are you?

231
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,721
What is it?

232
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,399
Please… Please save me.

233
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:14,860
Save me. Come down and do something!

234
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:19,281
Get down here, you crazy bastard!

235
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:22,118
Come here! Hurry!

236
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,497
Please get down and do something!

237
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:22,298
What exactly is that?

238
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:28,053
This is what lust demons turn into
when they die.

239
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:30,598
You really don't remember anything?

240
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:33,225
What am I supposed to know?

241
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:38,814
Hey! Wait! Hold on!

242
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:43,527
Why are you leaving like that?

243
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:46,488
You should at least try to explain
so that I understand…

244
00:31:50,868 --> 00:31:52,661
My legs really aren't moving.

245
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:55,331
Please help me.

246
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:02,379
Secretary Kang, who worked with me,

247
00:32:02,463 --> 00:32:04,298
also had something coming out
of his hands,

248
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:06,592
his eyes turned red,
and insects were coming out of his mouth--

249
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:07,926
He became a lust demon.

250
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:09,470
A lust demon…?

251
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:11,847
What's a lust demon?

252
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:15,267
Evil itself which leeched off this land
since the dawn of time.

253
00:32:15,351 --> 00:32:18,604
They kill humans and live forever
among them in their shapes.

254
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:20,189
They are everywhere.

255
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,274
They may appear from anywhere.

256
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,865
I would've called you a lunatic
if I didn't see it for myself.

257
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:35,788
You know,
like how I became a crazy woman today.

258
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:39,166
It makes me angrier
than the fact that I almost died.

259
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:40,793
No one believed me.

260
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:49,385
So, are you saying you're the only one
who can destroy lust demons?

261
00:32:49,677 --> 00:32:50,678
That's right.

262
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:56,058
But why are those lust demons
chasing after me?

263
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:59,687
It is your fate that calls upon them.

264
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:02,815
What nonsense.

265
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:07,528
Never mind! Anyway, what fate?

266
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:09,738
Are some people destined
to be eaten by monsters?

267
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:11,448
Nothing can be done
if you don't understand.

268
00:33:11,532 --> 00:33:12,700
You'll just have to die.

269
00:33:13,701 --> 00:33:15,703
Hey, hey! Just wait!

270
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:19,998
Can they get out of Jeju Island?

271
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:22,793
To Seoul? Or abroad?

272
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:26,547
Wherever you go,
lust demons will follow you till the end.

273
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:29,675
In human forms,
they'll try to lure and kill you.

274
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:31,385
Like that Secretary Kang or something.

275
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:35,305
Blame it on your fate.

276
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:44,398
Fight them if you can.

277
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:49,528
Hey.

278
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:06,939
If you're given another life,

279
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,151
I wish you a life of a normal human being.

280
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:58,282
GRANNY HAENYEO'S HOME

281
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:03,662
Van.

282
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:08,750
If that girl is truly Wonjeong,
she will certainly have a sign.

283
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:11,253
If the sign shines with light,

284
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:14,673
there is absolutely no doubt about it.

285
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:30,188
Go on, have a bite.

286
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,984
If you give me everything,
what are you going to sell?

287
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:37,571
I have enough to be able to feed you.

288
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,114
No…

289
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:42,534
This is too much.

290
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:45,746
This guy is here again?

291
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:49,249
Yeom-ji, why are you home already?

292
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:50,626
What about school?

293
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:53,420
Obviously, you'll prepare to sell alone
if I'm not here.

294
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:58,133
Also, you're trying to give him
free food again while I'm not here?

295
00:36:58,634 --> 00:37:01,261
Why does it matter to you
when I'm giving him free food?

296
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,680
Are you the owner? Are you?

297
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:05,682
Whose side are you on?

298
00:37:05,766 --> 00:37:07,726
I'm trying to collect your money for you.

299
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:16,151
Leave some money this time.
Or I'm not letting you go.

300
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:23,867
This guy!

301
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,495
Don't waste your energy and go inside.

302
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:30,040
Just wait. I'm going to get
every single cent back that he owes.

303
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:37,547
Is the investigation going well?

304
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:38,882
I guess…

305
00:37:40,676 --> 00:37:42,636
I'm following the traces of the record.

306
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:43,971
<i>But it's not easy.</i>

307
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:50,143
Father<i>, </i>do you know anything
about the man in the dark?

308
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:52,312
A very long time ago,

309
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:58,193
I saw him just once
when I first came to Jeju Island.

310
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:01,655
Really?

311
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:03,448
<i>How was it? What did he look like?</i>

312
00:38:03,532 --> 00:38:04,825
<i>Did he look scary?</i>

313
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:06,535
Also, what weapons does he use?

314
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:09,079
Does he change to a lust demon? Does he?

315
00:38:09,997 --> 00:38:13,458
When you meet him,
your excitement may turn into fear.

316
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:18,171
Fear, horror, and action
are all my specialties, Father.

317
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:33,311
<i>Wherever you go,</i>
<i>lust demons will follow you till the end.</i>

318
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,690
<i>In human forms,</i>
<i>they will try to lure and kill you.</i>

319
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:38,191
<i>Like that Secretary Kang or something.</i>

320
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:45,949
Yes.

321
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:59,838
Wow, your eyes are so scary.

322
00:39:00,422 --> 00:39:01,465
Why did you do it?

323
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:05,052
You're the one who stopped me
from getting on my flight, Mister.

324
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:07,012
It was all for your own good.

325
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:09,139
If you give up now and go back,

326
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:12,726
it's obvious that your aunt
and the ones around her will use this

327
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:15,937
as an excuse to try something
to bring you down.

328
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:18,065
Mister.

329
00:39:18,774 --> 00:39:20,650
I'm really scared.

330
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:24,237
It's you. You should believe me.

331
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:26,281
I believe you more than anyone else.

332
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,617
You do? Is that what you do
when you believe someone?

333
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:32,370
Miss, sleeping pills are…

334
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:36,541
Mister, I'll have nightmares
if I don't take these.

335
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,126
I need to take them.

336
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:39,544
Wait!

337
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,630
It's so late at night,

338
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:45,675
but I put so much effort making you tea
so you could sleep well.

339
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:48,011
I'll just throw it out then.

340
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:52,682
Here. Okay?

341
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,601
Okay.

342
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:57,729
Please have a good night.

343
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,621
It's hot!

344
00:40:22,671 --> 00:40:23,672
It's so frustrating!

345
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:29,344
God, Buddha, and…

346
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:32,931
No. Just to any god…

347
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:35,559
I'll go to church every week,

348
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:37,227
and I'll visit the temple every week too.

349
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,479
So please. Please save me.

350
00:40:40,856 --> 00:40:41,982
This is driving me nuts.

351
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:11,845
You! How did you get up here?

352
00:41:13,013 --> 00:41:14,014
Do you want to know?

353
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:16,975
No.

354
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:18,602
I don't want to know.

355
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:31,907
There was this lust demon I met before
that had sneaky eyes like yours.

356
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:34,701
And what happened?

357
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:37,871
I didn't kill it,
but I carved out its eyeballs.

358
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:41,583
So don't look at me like that.

359
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,793
I have a question.

360
00:41:45,629 --> 00:41:48,340
Are the monsters
that tried to kill me here too?

361
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,262
Are they here too?

362
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:55,680
Not anymore.

363
00:41:57,766 --> 00:41:59,517
How many more are there then?

364
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:00,727
Around ten?

365
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:02,312
Twenty?

366
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:04,940
I told you they were everywhere
and could appear from anywhere.

367
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:07,192
They are not beings that can be counted.

368
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,902
What should I do?

369
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:10,278
What must I do now?

370
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:12,155
-Just hide like you're doing now.
-Forever?

371
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:17,869
You said that this monster
will follow me wherever I go.

372
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:21,081
That people around
might turn out like Secretary Kang.

373
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:24,167
You want me to be stuck
in the corner of a room like this,

374
00:42:24,251 --> 00:42:26,544
doing nothing,
and not being able to do anything?

375
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:28,838
-Is that even living?
-You must if you want to live.

376
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,593
It might be better to just die.

377
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:37,180
Mom is dead.

378
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:40,141
And Aunt wants me dead.

379
00:42:41,268 --> 00:42:43,395
Dad wants me to live as if I'm dead.

380
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:47,148
My life is not that great

381
00:42:47,941 --> 00:42:51,069
so I don't really want
to be desperate to live.

382
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:53,321
But even so, this is not fair.

383
00:42:53,947 --> 00:42:57,575
My only options are to live in pain
or die painfully.

384
00:42:57,659 --> 00:42:59,286
That's not fair.

385
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:02,872
So…

386
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:07,252
So?

387
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:08,837
Why don't you work?

388
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:10,213
What?

389
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:11,506
Why don't you work

390
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,632
as a security guard?

391
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:13,883
Please protect me.

392
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:15,051
-What?
-What's wrong?

393
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:17,470
-Didn't you come to protect me?
-No, I didn't.

394
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:18,972
-Then why did you come?
-It's…

395
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:22,267
Did you follow me
because you fell in love at first sight?

396
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:24,185
Actually, never mind.

397
00:43:25,395 --> 00:43:28,982
I know that's not it,
and that there are no personal feelings.

398
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:32,319
Stop with the internal conflict,
and protect me officially.

399
00:43:33,987 --> 00:43:34,988
Have you gone mad?

400
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:37,240
Do you think you're worth it?

401
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:40,327
How can you put a value
to a person like…

402
00:43:44,706 --> 00:43:47,042
No. That's not it.

403
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:50,420
You haven't seen it with your own eyes,

404
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:52,922
so it's understandable
that you don't know my value.

405
00:43:54,007 --> 00:43:55,008
Fine, then.

406
00:43:55,759 --> 00:43:56,843
How much do you want?

407
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:01,306
We should write a contract
at least, right?

408
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,060
Verbal agreement has legal effects,

409
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:07,604
but having a written one
would be more effective.

410
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:13,568
I'm asking just in case,
but do you have an identification?

411
00:44:14,778 --> 00:44:15,904
Oh, you don't have one.

412
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:18,740
Your resident registration number then?

413
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:21,326
Oh, you don't have one.

414
00:44:22,035 --> 00:44:23,036
Then a phone number…

415
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:25,622
I guess I can make one up, right?

416
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:27,374
I'll get you a new phone.

417
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:29,542
Your name is?

418
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:31,127
Your name.

419
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:35,924
-Van.
-Van?

420
00:44:38,093 --> 00:44:39,094
Van what?

421
00:44:40,387 --> 00:44:41,388
Just Van?

422
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:43,515
Vanny Van?

423
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,185
You're making a scary face.

424
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:48,978
Just Van, then.

425
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:52,524
I'll read out the contract quickly.

426
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,775
This is a service contract

427
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:55,860
between Won Mi-ho, the client,
and Van, the contractor.

428
00:44:55,944 --> 00:44:59,155
The contractor must protect the client
from lust demons every day.

429
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:02,534
The client will compensate
the contractor financially, including tax,

430
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:03,618
in cash.

431
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,162
You should just move in here.

432
00:45:06,246 --> 00:45:09,624
That would be better if you
want to watch me closely every day.

433
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:10,834
Right?

434
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:12,961
We now need to write down the salary.

435
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:16,464
In the salary section,
write down the amount you want.

436
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:19,050
-Why don't we stop the joke here?
-What?

437
00:45:19,134 --> 00:45:20,343
I don't make promises.

438
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:22,011
Wait! Hold on.

439
00:45:24,681 --> 00:45:26,599
You're making a mistake here.

440
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:29,602
This is your chance to become

441
00:45:29,686 --> 00:45:31,813
a business partner
of Daehan Group's Won Mi-ho.

442
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:33,523
You're just going to let this chance go?

443
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:36,276
Hey! Wait!

444
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:38,611
I'm sorry.

445
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:41,239
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry,

446
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:43,366
but just for tonight…

447
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:46,327
Can you stay with me just for tonight?

448
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:52,208
I'm not the type to ask a guy
to stay with me overnight.

449
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:56,045
I'm just…

450
00:45:57,088 --> 00:45:59,007
It's because I'm just really scared.

451
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,889
You're dark and scary.

452
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,641
But lust demons are even scarier.

453
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:12,187
I'm really sleepy because I'm exhausted.

454
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:13,938
I can't fall asleep.

455
00:46:15,023 --> 00:46:16,024
I can't sleep.

456
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:41,174
<i>If that girl is truly Wonjeong,</i>

457
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,010
<i>she will certainly have a sign.</i>

458
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:12,557
I knew it.

459
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:14,309
Why would he refuse money?

460
00:48:19,522 --> 00:48:20,523
Wait a moment.

461
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:22,942
Why didn't he write the salary?

462
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,487
It wouldn't be for free.

463
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:31,242
Wait. Does he want me to pay
whatever he wants?

464
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:01,648
I'll be back to save you no matter what.

465
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:10,490
Please wait for me.

466
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:12,909
I promise you.

467
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:20,875
<i>Why did you…</i>

468
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:24,170
<i>make such a promise to me?</i>

469
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:27,590
<i>Van!</i>

470
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:39,852
It's been a while.

471
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:16,097
<i>Should I resent you for forgetting me?</i>

472
00:50:17,098 --> 00:50:18,307
<i>Or should I be grateful?</i>

473
00:51:47,063 --> 00:51:50,066
