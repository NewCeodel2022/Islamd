1
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:23,482
ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS DEPICTED
IN THIS SERIES ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:26,026
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED SAFELY
IN THE PRESENCE OF THEIR GUARDIANS.

3
00:00:38,456 --> 00:00:39,665
Van…

4
00:02:12,258 --> 00:02:13,968
Mi-ho!

5
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,318
What happened?

6
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:15,321
-I needed to confirm.
-Confirm what?

7
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:19,199
To see if he is dangerous or not.

8
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:24,622
But at the last moment,
he stabbed his own arm.

9
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,999
So he protected the lady.

10
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:32,171
When he transformed…

11
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,965
he became a lust demon.

12
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:39,637
When I first met Van,
I thought the same as you.

13
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:42,389
Priest Johan.

14
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:46,143
Didn't you see for yourself?

15
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:49,438
He protected the lady
by sacrificing his own arm.

16
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:52,274
-That's--
-Van protected this land for a long time.

17
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:56,278
And Van has protected the lady until now.

18
00:03:58,656 --> 00:03:59,740
You cannot deny that.

19
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,868
You confirmed your suspicions.

20
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,579
Now you should know.

21
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:10,542
Van is… the only one
who can protect the lady.

22
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:13,420
No.

23
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:16,715
I only confirmed his true identity.

24
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:19,051
I can't let him do that.

25
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:22,888
I will protect her.

26
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:25,432
That is my choice.

27
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:52,084
<i>I'm worried if you use</i>
<i>your abilities too much,</i>

28
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:55,462
<i>you might permanently</i>
<i>become a lust demon.</i>

29
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,702
{\an8}The wood smells so good.

30
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:51,912
{\an8}Hello.

31
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,498
{\an8}I'm exhausted.

32
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,166
{\an8}Let's take a little break.

33
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:59,628
{\an8}We have to hurry up
to finish the course.

34
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,340
{\an8}Are we doing a marathon at Jeju Island?

35
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:07,177
{\an8}-Let's take a break.
-Stop it already!

36
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,012
{\an8}You're being a pest.

37
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,515
{\an8}Don't come up if you don't want to, then.

38
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:14,685
{\an8}You are being so weak.
I can't go with you at this rate.

39
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:17,062
{\an8}Whatever!

40
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,858
{\an8}-Go up first, I will follow up.
-Sure, whatever.

41
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:23,485
{\an8}This is nice.

42
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:25,737
{\an8}I'm dying.

43
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,802
This is not mine.

44
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:11,658
Grandma, did you have breakfast?

45
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:13,535
Take care of the aunts first.

46
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,120
Thank you.

47
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,917
<i>A murder case targeting</i>
<i>Jeju Island tourists has occurred.</i>

48
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,793
<i>The victim was a lady in her fifties.</i>

49
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:24,838
<i>Some of her organs have been</i>
<i>intentionally removed,</i>

50
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:27,341
<i>-causing shock among the people.</i>
<i>-</i>Is that the Fox Demon?

51
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,550
It looks like it.

52
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:31,511
It takes the form of a human
and eats your insides.

53
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,972
That sounds scary.

54
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:38,810
They said on television
that it killed three people.

55
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:41,521
Grandmothers, have some breakfast.

56
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:43,565
Okay, thank you.

57
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,694
But, what is a Fox Demon?

58
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,488
Oh, that?

59
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,824
I heard from my grandmother
when I was younger.

60
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:56,536
It lived in that village long before
my grandma was even born.

61
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:59,623
It lived off eating people's livers,

62
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,667
and it never died.

63
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,461
Yeom-ji, aren't you late for school?
Go on now.

64
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:06,922
I'm going now.

65
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,761
-I will be going now.
-Okay.

66
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,765
She grew up so much.

67
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:22,229
MURDER CASES CONTINUE
TARGETING THE JEJU TOURISTS

68
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,398
Mi-ho!

69
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,233
Are you awake?

70
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:28,568
I'm coming in.

71
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:40,057
If I knew it would be like this,
I would have worn hiking clothes.

72
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:48,815
I'm sure he stopped by here,
according to the phone GPS.

73
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,516
Is this a historical site?

74
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:36,029
Found you.

75
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:40,992
Wait.

76
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:43,995
Go back.

77
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,248
Before I return,

78
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,208
let me see your wound first.

79
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,793
Did you already forget?

80
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,089
What I did to you?

81
00:11:58,427 --> 00:11:59,594
You tried to kill me.

82
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,182
But you also tried to save me.

83
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:05,892
Multiple times.

84
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:07,936
Don't come.

85
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,898
I might not be myself next time.

86
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,234
You protected me.

87
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,864
Sacrificing your own arm.

88
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,284
You protected me until the end.

89
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,247
You can't be that stupid.

90
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:30,333
I can't guarantee anymore…

91
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:32,335
that I will not kill you.

92
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,671
So, stop and go back.

93
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:37,174
You said you will protect me.

94
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:39,885
You promised to protect me!

95
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:42,888
Promise?

96
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:45,724
Should I show you once again

97
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:47,809
how meaningless that promise can be?

98
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,648
Okay, fine. Don't protect me then.

99
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,650
I also have a self-esteem.

100
00:12:57,903 --> 00:12:59,654
I will never beg for your help again.

101
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,830
But… let's make this one thing clear.

102
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:14,961
It's not the promise that is weak.

103
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:17,339
It is your will that is weak.

104
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:41,404
Mi-ho!

105
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:44,866
Why did you come out?

106
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:46,993
I was not doing much.

107
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:49,037
Where did you go
so early in the morning?

108
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:50,622
I was worried.

109
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,419
-I went hiking.
-Mi-ho.

110
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,839
From today onward,
don't go anywhere without me.

111
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:04,302
I will be your personal bodyguard,
right by your side.

112
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:07,055
I was worried with Van not being here.

113
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:08,473
I asked him to do so.

114
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:12,102
But, is this right?

115
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:14,604
Johan has to investigate--

116
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,566
No, you said you had to study.

117
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:20,151
I am good at multi-tasking.

118
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:22,654
I will study and bodyguard you
at the same time.

119
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:25,824
Miss, please consent to it.

120
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,619
I look forward to your cooperation.

121
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:32,247
I will get ready for work now.

122
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,042
Yes.

123
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,962
Please find out where it is.

124
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,382
Okay, thank you.

125
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:49,889
Mi-ho.

126
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:51,725
-Yes?
-I'm over here.

127
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:55,520
Your bodyguard.

128
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:58,815
Okay, get in now.

129
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:28,595
Is it really okay for you
to be alone in the counseling room?

130
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,972
You're not in a position
to worry about others.

131
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:33,475
Are you okay to teach alone?
How many classes today?

132
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:37,562
Or should I take you to the classroom?

133
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:39,356
Or how about this?

134
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:41,733
I will be a student in disguise.

135
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,610
A student from Italy.

136
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:46,738
Father Johan, please calm down.

137
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:50,492
If you wear the school uniform,
do you think the girls will let you go?

138
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:53,203
If it wasn't for your uniform,
I'd have to protect you.

139
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,371
No way…

140
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:58,166
-This is because of you!
-Move aside!

141
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,628
She's the girl
who met the college student.

142
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:03,880
Oh, that's her? What a joke.

143
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:06,549
It's okay.

144
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:10,887
It will be okay.

145
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,942
Do you know what's best
for treating your wounds?

146
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:27,779
Time.

147
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:32,325
Taking care of the wound
as soon as you can.

148
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:35,870
But before that,

149
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:39,916
knowing how deep
your wound actually is.

150
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,296
It will take a while.

151
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,382
Maybe a lifetime.

152
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:52,011
So take your time.
Don't force yourself too much.

153
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:56,516
The wounds hurt too much for that, right?

154
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:01,771
Thank you.

155
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:07,402
-But…
-Yes? You can tell me anything.

156
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:11,990
Who are you?

157
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:18,455
Oh, I am…

158
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:19,539
Su-ryeon!

159
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:26,921
You came.

160
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:30,133
Yes. This is the teacher, Won Mi-ho.

161
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,843
Oh!

162
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:35,472
Nice to meet you. Thank you!

163
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:38,933
Sure. How do you feel these days?

164
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:42,729
Thanks to you, I feel much better.

165
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:46,232
Although… I do not remember much,

166
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,194
I heard from Yeom-ji.

167
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:51,696
Thank you very much.

168
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:56,201
It's fine. It was nothing.

169
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:57,911
Father, I see you came too.

170
00:17:58,536 --> 00:17:59,537
Yes.

171
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,456
Then, is he the one…

172
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:03,416
Yes, the one I told you about.

173
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,001
He is the priest. Johan.

174
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,588
Oh, thank you. Thank you, Father.

175
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,924
You can stop thanking us now.

176
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:14,886
Anyways, seeing you at school is nice.

177
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:19,265
If something happens,
don't hesitate to tell me, okay?

178
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:22,852
Okay.

179
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,813
Let's go now.

180
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:26,689
-Go in now.
-Okay.

181
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,025
Goodbye.

182
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,034
-That was nice.
-What was nice?

183
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:41,538
Seeing you brighten up.

184
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:44,457
Me? Since when?

185
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:48,294
Hello.

186
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,925
-We meet again.
-Hello.

187
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:56,719
-Wow.
-You saw him before, right?

188
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:59,973
He wanted to look around the school.
As you can see, he's a priest.

189
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:03,142
I had a feeling!
Your face shines light!

190
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:06,271
Wow, enough of your flattery.

191
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:09,107
You are picking out
the bridesmaid dress today, right?

192
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,401
Wow, I thought you would have forgotten.

193
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,445
Girl, I marked it with a star
on my calendar to go with you.

194
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,281
I will go to your cafe after work.

195
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:17,365
Sure.

196
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:20,118
Make sure to bring the priest too.

197
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:25,623
If possible, it would be nice
if Butler Jang comes as well.

198
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:27,542
I can't believe you.

199
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,169
Are you really going to do
the wedding at the cafe?

200
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:32,338
You should do it at our hotel's garden.

201
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:35,300
If I do it at your hotel,
it will not be a small wedding.

202
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:36,384
It will be a big one.

203
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,346
What does it matter if it's big or not?

204
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:44,893
What's important is that Su-jin
is getting married next week.

205
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:48,396
I never imagined you
becoming a married woman.

206
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:50,148
I'm so proud of you.

207
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,066
I know, right?

208
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,819
I want to be proud of you too.
Is there no way for you?

209
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:58,031
No way. Go away now.

210
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:03,161
If you have time later,
please come with Mi-ho!

211
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:04,704
-You must come!
-Okay.

212
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:06,915
That girl…

213
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:10,293
Honey, I'm going to go with Mi-ho later.
Make us some delicious food.

214
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:13,504
Every time I see her,
she has a nice impression.

215
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:15,173
Right?

216
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:18,426
The only friend who sees me as I am.

217
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,263
If it wasn't for her,
I wouldn't have come to Tamra High School.

218
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:26,017
She is getting married next week
to her long-time boyfriend.

219
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:30,730
The groom-to-be came down to Jeju
and gave up everything back in Seoul.

220
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:34,567
They look so great together.
I'm jealous of them.

221
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,320
-You're jealous?
-Yes.

222
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:39,656
Let's go.

223
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,705
The guest should lay their hands off.

224
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,041
I told you I'm serving you a meal today.

225
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:58,341
I feel like my grandma.

226
00:20:58,424 --> 00:20:59,425
Do you agree?

227
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,764
We ran out of chicken soup.
Have some steamed chicken.

228
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:08,685
Have a drink of this too.

229
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:13,898
Be careful, it's hot. It's going in now.

230
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:15,024
Here you go.

231
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:22,657
I want the rice cakes.

232
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,246
It's good, right?

233
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:31,666
Look at the cheese.

234
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:33,876
What?

235
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:36,254
I said thank you.

236
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:40,508
What's wrong with you?

237
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:42,635
I'm sorry.

238
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,391
For yelling and getting mad at you before.

239
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,644
Hey, why all of a sudden?

240
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:56,315
If it was me,
you would have done the same, right?

241
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:58,693
Just eat the chicken.

242
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,491
You were going to
commemorate the dead looking like this?

243
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:11,164
But… why are you here?

244
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:13,291
You should be with the girl.

245
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,339
I can't do that.
I will watch her from afar.

246
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:22,717
Why?

247
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:25,720
I almost killed her again.

248
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:32,226
Perhaps…

249
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:36,230
I might be more dangerous to her
than a lust demon is.

250
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,526
She can live only if I am not there.

251
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,073
Van.

252
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:48,534
Do you know why people reincarnate?

253
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:51,537
To repent for their past sins.

254
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,416
And a chance to wash away their sins.

255
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,712
It is a chance for a new
and redeemed life again and again.

256
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:05,927
<i>Why are you trapped in a fate</i>
<i>worse than reincarnation,</i>

257
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:13,059
<i>always mourning the dead</i>
<i>with those clothes on?</i>

258
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:19,023
<i>The belief that you are able to</i>
<i>release yourself from that fate.</i>

259
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,985
Was it not because of that belief?

260
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:27,824
No.

261
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,118
It became deviated after that.

262
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,788
The only way I can be
released from this fate…

263
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:37,333
is if I die.

264
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:40,920
I'm leaving.

265
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:53,975
-We are back.
-Hello.

266
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:56,602
Good job today, Miss.

267
00:23:56,686 --> 00:24:00,857
Johan did a great job
comfortably riding in the passenger seat.

268
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:04,944
It was not difficult at all
because I was talking with Mi-ho.

269
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,157
This looks great!

270
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:13,494
Hold on.

271
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:16,414
Hello? Yes.

272
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:19,250
Yes. Kang Chan-hee.

273
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:21,752
Yes, correct. He is my older brother.

274
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:24,380
Brother?

275
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:28,718
Mister, you have another nephew?

276
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:32,138
Well, yes…

277
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:33,222
Wow.

278
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:36,058
That's insane.

279
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,021
Okay.

280
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:41,898
It's fine.

281
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:43,900
Okay.

282
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:57,205
<i>Johan was separated from his older brother</i>
<i>when they were younger.</i>

283
00:24:57,872 --> 00:25:01,292
<i>They both were adopted together</i>
<i>and were separated there as well.</i>

284
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:04,378
<i>He has been looking for his brother</i>
<i>ever since.</i>

285
00:25:05,463 --> 00:25:08,216
Kang Chan-hee!
Why aren't you coming out to clean?

286
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:09,759
I'm coming!

287
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:23,314
Hey, what's taking you so long to clean?

288
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,484
He's so weak and slow.

289
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:30,905
We're going out now,
so clean inside of the cabin as well.

290
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:36,452
He drives me insane.

291
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,871
Chan-hee, he is not fit for this.

292
00:25:39,664 --> 00:25:41,332
What should we do with him?

293
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:52,301
So, did your pain go away?

294
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:55,179
I see you had a hard time…

295
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:58,724
looking for this.

296
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:02,979
Out of pity,

297
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:07,900
I will tell you
how to get rid of your pain.

298
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:21,163
Hey, did you make sure
Chan-hee does a good job?

299
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:23,541
Whatever. Forget about him.

300
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,710
-Captain.
-Yes?

301
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:29,880
-Will you keep sailing?
-I don't know. I need to go pee.

302
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:32,174
-Let me go pee first.
-Come back quickly.

303
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:06,000
Let me live…

304
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:13,632
This is not mine.

305
00:27:13,716 --> 00:27:14,800
Sir!

306
00:27:14,884 --> 00:27:16,886
Are you going to pee all day?

307
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:54,984
Hey you, what are you doing here?

308
00:28:56,861 --> 00:28:58,028
Well…

309
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:02,616
I couldn't find the gas tank.

310
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,911
These guys made the youngest guy
do all the work

311
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:07,705
and went off to drink.

312
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,499
Hey, eat some ramyeon first.

313
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:13,085
Okay.

314
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:32,688
Do you really have to work here?

315
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:38,235
I need to earn money.

316
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:39,653
The way I see it,

317
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:42,531
your medicines will cost more.

318
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:03,177
Here.

319
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,389
Why don't you look for another job?

320
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:10,726
Take it.

321
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:20,402
You can use
the motorcycle outside as well.

322
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:23,405
Thank you.

323
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:39,922
You look like the Dol Hareubang.

324
00:30:42,091 --> 00:30:46,053
Bodyguard, we have somewhere to go.
Come out now.

325
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:50,432
Okay, Mi-ho.

326
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:54,728
Where are we going?

327
00:30:54,812 --> 00:30:56,105
Su-jin's cafe.

328
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:05,406
Johan.

329
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:08,075
Don't worry.

330
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:10,828
About what?

331
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:12,746
About anything.

332
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:15,666
You have me.

333
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:21,380
-Who?
-Me! It's me.

334
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:26,051
You don't realize
how dependent I can be, right?

335
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:29,972
I don't get what you are trying to say.

336
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:32,808
Just look out the window.

337
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:49,867
-I should bring this out, right?
-Yes.

338
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:54,997
Su-jin!

339
00:31:56,165 --> 00:31:58,083
Why did you come so late?

340
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:00,669
-Hello.
-Hello.

341
00:32:00,753 --> 00:32:03,005
-There are a lot of customers.
-I know, right?

342
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,506
Where is Seung-joon?

343
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:06,300
Honey!

344
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:09,011
-Mi-ho is here.
-Oh, Mi-ho!

345
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:13,265
-How have you been?
-Good. How about you?

346
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:17,686
Here you go.

347
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:20,773
Wow, that looks delicious.

348
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:22,608
Father, eat up.

349
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:23,692
Thank you.

350
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:24,777
And…

351
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:26,904
here is the wedding invitation.

352
00:32:29,657 --> 00:32:31,825
It's so pretty. You said it was next week?

353
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:33,118
Yes.

354
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:38,999
Father, if you come to give your blessing,
it will be much appreciated.

355
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:40,668
Hey!

356
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,545
Wow! What's this?

357
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:44,713
How does it look?

358
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:46,965
Wow.

359
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:48,217
Model pose!

360
00:32:49,343 --> 00:32:50,469
Su-jin, it's beautiful.

361
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:51,762
Pose!

362
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:54,098
Wow!

363
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:55,974
-How is it?
-It's beautiful.

364
00:32:56,058 --> 00:32:57,935
-Really?
-Mi-ho, you look pretty.

365
00:32:58,018 --> 00:32:59,603
-Is it pretty?
-Yes.

366
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:03,607
-Does it fit well?
-Yes, how did you make it so pretty?

367
00:33:03,691 --> 00:33:07,403
Making the wedding dress
and the bridesmaid dress

368
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:10,155
all by myself
with my own design was my dream.

369
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:11,448
It's the best.

370
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,992
Su-jin learned to sew.

371
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:15,327
Really?

372
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:18,956
Oh, right. Honey, Mi-ho gave us
as her wedding present

373
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,875
an unlimited stay
at Daehan Hotel suite room.

374
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:24,753
What? You shouldn't have!

375
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:28,173
Really? I will take it back then.

376
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:30,884
She brought it all this way here for me.

377
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:33,679
It is not polite to make her take it back.

378
00:33:59,455 --> 00:34:03,959
Why are you wandering about
like a stray cat?

379
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,127
Did you have dinner?

380
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:06,462
No.

381
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,506
Did you hear?

382
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:13,552
Another body was found
at the Panho-ri bar.

383
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:15,095
Again?

384
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:18,432
Were the organs and liver taken out again?

385
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:21,935
We thought so too, but not this time.

386
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:25,481
They said the body
was full of knife wounds.

387
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:30,611
According to the police,
the body had 12 deep knife wounds.

388
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:33,947
What is going on here?

389
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:36,116
Where is that body?

390
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:39,453
Who are you to talk so impolitely?

391
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:42,623
I asked you, where is that body?

392
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:46,877
It is probably at
the big university hospital in Panho-ri.

393
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:55,552
The world is sure to end soon.

394
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:58,806
Youngsters these days
have no respect for the elders now.

395
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:00,265
You don't even know.

396
00:35:01,225 --> 00:35:03,685
DAEHAN MEDICAL CENTER

397
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:51,692
Gungtan…

398
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,183
Do you have a schedule today?

399
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:08,018
School today…

400
00:37:08,477 --> 00:37:11,313
Let's go!
There is an important appointment today.

401
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:13,273
-Where to?
-It's a secret.

402
00:37:13,357 --> 00:37:14,399
Wait.

403
00:37:14,483 --> 00:37:16,276
-Let me just get my clothes.
-Hurry up.

404
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,611
Okay.

405
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:36,296
You came.

406
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,298
-Good job today.
-Thank you.

407
00:37:49,643 --> 00:37:54,690
HOPE ORPHANAGE

408
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,235
<i>Okay, look over here now.</i>

409
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:02,197
Wrap your arms around his shoulders.

410
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:03,907
Sweetly.

411
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:07,327
Chan-hyeok, look over there.

412
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:11,498
Perfect.

413
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:13,875
Smile now.

414
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:14,960
Smile widely!

415
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:17,546
These photos will be shown
to your adoptive parents.

416
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:20,048
Just like that, smile a bit.

417
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:22,884
Mi-ho.

418
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:24,803
This place…

419
00:38:25,429 --> 00:38:27,931
Yes, it is the orphanage you stayed at.

420
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:30,475
Is Johan's older brother in Korea?

421
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:32,436
I think so.

422
00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:36,189
Mister, you're so smart.

423
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:39,818
You should use our company's resources.

424
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:42,904
Our company's legal team is great.

425
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,034
Finding a person should be
a piece of cake for them.

426
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:51,163
Contact them immediately
to find the elder nephew.

427
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:54,875
Yes, of course.

428
00:39:00,881 --> 00:39:03,508
-Shall we get going?
-Yes, come inside.

429
00:39:04,051 --> 00:39:05,052
Let's go.

430
00:39:29,785 --> 00:39:35,415
HOPE ORPHANAGE

431
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,511
<i>Chan-hyeok!</i>

432
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:17,184
Chan-hyeok, what are you doing here?

433
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:23,106
Let's go now. Everyone is waiting.

434
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:28,904
Chan-hyeok, we now have
a mom and a dad too!

435
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,323
-Really?
-Yes.

436
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:32,991
Let's go.

437
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:51,218
<i>Greet them now.</i>

438
00:41:51,301 --> 00:41:52,928
Hi.

439
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:56,014
<i>Hi, it's so nice to meet you.</i>

440
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:57,599
<i>What's your name?</i>

441
00:42:07,901 --> 00:42:10,987
Johan. Are you okay?

442
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:21,289
It seems the facility was opened
without proper authorization.

443
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:26,336
The facility closed down
after Chan-hee and Chan-hyeok got adopted.

444
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:31,591
So where is Kang Chan-hee now?

445
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:33,301
He is not too far from here.

446
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:39,474
-My brother is nearby?
-Yes.

447
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:41,476
It is a place called Bongyong-ho.

448
00:42:47,524 --> 00:42:48,692
Good job.

449
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:09,754
Mi-ho.

450
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:16,845
I'm not sure how to show
my gratitude for this…

451
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:19,597
Did you decide what to say
once you meet your brother?

452
00:43:34,863 --> 00:43:35,864
To my brother…

453
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,578
I wanted to apologize.

454
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:44,748
I often did not listen to my brother.

455
00:43:45,874 --> 00:43:50,211
Johan, your brother
will not remember you that way.

456
00:44:12,734 --> 00:44:14,652
After I see you return to the villa,

457
00:44:15,278 --> 00:44:18,406
I will go see my brother on my own.

458
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,409
Sure, let's do that.

459
00:44:22,786 --> 00:44:24,371
Shall we go now?

460
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:50,105
-I said I will drop you off there.
-Your safety is more important.

461
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,690
Then take this car and go.

462
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:55,235
I don't have a license.

463
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:57,320
Oh…

464
00:44:58,113 --> 00:45:00,949
-Then I will call a cab for you--
-Mi-ho, it's fine.

465
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:04,244
-I'll be fine on my own.
-Johan, wait!

466
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:06,704
Are you really fine on your own?

467
00:45:07,122 --> 00:45:09,082
It's right for me
to go see him on my own.

468
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:10,166
I'll be back.

469
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:12,335
-Be careful and be safe!
-Okay, you too.

470
00:45:14,546 --> 00:45:17,340
-Be safe!
-Go inside now, bye!

471
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:20,885
Hello, Su-jin!

472
00:45:20,969 --> 00:45:22,053
<i>Mi-ho!</i>

473
00:45:22,137 --> 00:45:24,305
I forgot to give this to you yesterday.

474
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:28,143
I handmade a corsage for you
for the wedding as well.

475
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:30,603
Wow, really?

476
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:33,565
And I even made a carrot cake for you.

477
00:45:34,149 --> 00:45:35,942
I will bring it over to you.

478
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:38,319
Really?
You don't have to come all this way.

479
00:45:38,862 --> 00:45:41,489
We were very grateful
for your wedding present.

480
00:45:41,823 --> 00:45:43,616
We thought we had to do something for you.

481
00:45:45,869 --> 00:45:50,081
Seung-joon looks like he is
making something for you too.

482
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:52,750
I can't believe you guys.

483
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:54,794
I will just go to you instead.

484
00:45:54,878 --> 00:45:56,004
No, wait.

485
00:45:57,589 --> 00:45:59,382
Honey, you are fine with going, right?

486
00:46:00,592 --> 00:46:01,801
He said he will go.

487
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:04,679
I still have some grading left to do.

488
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:06,598
<i>I know you will miss me.</i>

489
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:10,643
I can't believe I have friends like you.

490
00:46:11,728 --> 00:46:14,105
I guess Won Mi-ho's life
isn't too bad after all.

491
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:17,192
Well, I have a friend who is
extremely wealthy and powerful.

492
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:19,360
I guess I didn't live
my life too bad either.

493
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:21,362
Of course it's not if I'm in your life.

494
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:26,493
-I'm sorry for making you go alone.
-It's fine.

495
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:28,620
I will be back real soon.

496
00:46:29,037 --> 00:46:31,915
Then I won't close
and will wait for you at the cafe.

497
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:37,420
Let me open the door for you.

498
00:46:40,048 --> 00:46:41,132
Thank you.

499
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:08,076
-Hey, Su-jin.
-Did you arrive yet?

500
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:09,160
<i>Yes.</i>

501
00:47:09,244 --> 00:47:10,912
I followed the GPS,

502
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:13,998
but the map connection got cut off here.

503
00:47:14,374 --> 00:47:17,085
From here on,
I will just follow Mi-ho's directions

504
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:18,711
and hopefully it will come up.

505
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:20,588
Okay, come back quickly.

506
00:47:20,672 --> 00:47:21,673
Okay.

507
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:26,362
Hello.

508
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:28,948
Do you know where Bongyong-ho is?

509
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:32,452
Bongyong-ho… should be around there.

510
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:31,469
Gungtan…

511
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:45,233
Okay, I will go out first
so he doesn't have to wait.

512
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:49,028
Van.

513
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,039
Seung-joon…

514
00:50:13,803 --> 00:50:14,804
Seung-joon!

515
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:20,268
Mister! Van! How can this be?

516
00:50:22,562 --> 00:50:24,689
Why did this happen?

517
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:30,069
Mister… Van!

518
00:50:30,153 --> 00:50:31,154
What should we do?

519
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:56,804
Excuse me.

520
00:51:01,309 --> 00:51:02,310
Hello?

521
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:44,268
Excuse me.

522
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:47,855
Hello?

523
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:54,237
Who are you?

524
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:11,546
Who did you come to meet?

525
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:14,298
Do you know…

526
00:52:15,383 --> 00:52:16,676
A Kang Chan-hee?

527
00:52:21,222 --> 00:52:22,265
Chan-hyeok…

528
00:52:24,517 --> 00:52:25,518
Are you…

529
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,521
Chan-hyeok?

530
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,104
It's been a while, my brother.

531
00:53:17,236 --> 00:53:18,237
Gungtan…

532
00:55:13,973 --> 00:55:19,887
