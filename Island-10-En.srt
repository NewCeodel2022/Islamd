1
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:23,482
ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS DEPICTED
IN THIS SERIES ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:26,068
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED SAFELY IN
THE PRESENCE OF THEIR GUARDIANS.

3
00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:14,533
A long time ago, this place was scary

4
00:01:15,326 --> 00:01:17,286
and cozy at the same time.

5
00:01:20,456 --> 00:01:22,458
Now that I look at it, it's pathetic.

6
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,842
Why are you still staying
at a place like this?

7
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:38,516
Is it because of something
like remorse and repentance?

8
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,148
So has it somewhat freed you from guilt?

9
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:51,779
I could never understand you burying them
and building stone towers for them.

10
00:01:58,869 --> 00:01:59,954
Don't you feel cheated?

11
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:04,250
Those who locked us up in here
like we were wild dogs

12
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,294
and spoke to us
like this was everything in the world…

13
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:10,381
Aren't they disgraceful?

14
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:16,929
It wasn't our fault, Van.

15
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:21,725
We just did what we had to do.

16
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:34,280
I'm not like you,

17
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:38,742
who kills innocent people for fun
because you are hungry.

18
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,330
You're right.

19
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,876
Looking back, you were quite smart.

20
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:53,257
The fact that we only had to take one life
to escape this place…

21
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:55,217
You knew it already.

22
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:58,387
Shut up.

23
00:02:58,888 --> 00:02:59,889
So this time…

24
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:03,601
when are you going to kill her?

25
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:11,358
Why do you think
I've been just watching you?

26
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:13,944
Because what I have is a certainty.

27
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:20,784
A certainty without the slightest doubt
that you will kill her again.

28
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:28,375
It's not too late to be honest
and admit that you fear her.

29
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:34,715
Isn't that why you sent lust demons
instead of taking it into your own hands?

30
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,302
So how did you feel…

31
00:03:42,473 --> 00:03:44,350
when Wonjeong sealed you?

32
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:53,943
The only things there
were emptiness and nothingness.

33
00:03:55,152 --> 00:04:01,325
There was no sense of time or pain,
and I couldn't even think I was thinking.

34
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:02,952
It was an empty place.

35
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:11,752
If you cannot kill her,
that's the place we'll end up together.

36
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:15,547
How does it sound, my brother?

37
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:21,178
Well, I'm not interested
in a place like that.

38
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:28,477
The blood of lust demons
runs in both you and me.

39
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,814
Our blood cannot be pure again.

40
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:42,199
If it can't be made pure again,
it must be drawn out. That's all.

41
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,201
Sounds like you'll get in my way again.

42
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:47,913
I cannot let my brother
feel the emptiness again.

43
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,002
I'll be the one to draw out your blood.

44
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:22,382
{\an8}Are you okay?
It seemed like you were severely hurt.

45
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:30,140
{\an8}-How about you?
-I'm okay, unlike someone.

46
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:35,187
{\an8}What was that?

47
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:38,524
{\an8}It seemed like either a ghost or a shadow.

48
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,569
{\an8}It seemed different
from the lust demons we faced until now.

49
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,906
A monster
that makes a person commit suicide…

50
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:50,494
It's called Gunsunsae, an evil spirit
that has long been present on Jeju.

51
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:56,041
It was never this evil,
but lust demons probably took over it.

52
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:57,709
Just like with Benjulle.

53
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:01,839
So, how can we kill it?

54
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:34,538
Let's go together.

55
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:36,665
You can't save them all alone.

56
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:39,751
I'm not going there to save people.
I'm not interested in such a thing.

57
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:41,253
Sorry?

58
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,634
I can sense Gusunsae's energy.
I think I just need to take care of it.

59
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,887
-Let's go together then.
-No.

60
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:54,141
Do what you want to do well.
Protect Won Mi-ho.

61
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:57,519
That will be enough.

62
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,694
Su-jin…

63
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,658
I'm sorry.

64
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:02,329
I'm sorry, Su-jin.

65
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,961
Su-jin!

66
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:11,671
Su-jin…

67
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:28,688
NO OPEN FLAME

68
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,621
What the…

69
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:49,811
Miss.

70
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:55,650
Miss!

71
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,302
Su-jin.

72
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:28,892
Su-jin!

73
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:38,527
Miss.

74
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,113
Mister.

75
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:45,200
You shouldn't be outside.

76
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:46,910
Let's go back inside quickly.

77
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,495
Su-jin is over there.

78
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:50,872
I must go to Su-jin.

79
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:58,880
Wow, that was close.

80
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,007
Are you okay?

81
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:02,968
Hey!

82
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,052
Hey, wait a minute.

83
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:05,804
Hey… Excuse me!

84
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,725
I'm sorry, but I don't have much time now.

85
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,437
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

86
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,022
Amen.

87
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:32,497
Butler Chang, how much do you trust him?

88
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,667
Do you want me to show you
the truth about him?

89
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:47,095
What do you think will happen to Won Mi-ho
once she regains her memory of Wonjeong?

90
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:49,347
She is just a shell anyway.

91
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:53,268
Don't worry about it,
regardless of what happens.

92
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:56,688
What we need is Wonjeong, right?

93
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:02,611
But Father Chang, were you by her side
all your life with that mindset?

94
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:07,282
I'm just carrying out God's mission.
To me, there's nothing more to it.

95
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:18,627
Miss.

96
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:22,672
Miss!

97
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,519
See? I was right, wasn't I?

98
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:27,278
Miss…

99
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:31,533
Tell me.

100
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:36,996
Tell me that it's not true

101
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,458
and that you have never deceived me.

102
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:47,424
Tell me that you didn't approach me
to turn me into Wonjeong.

103
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,149
Father Peter…

104
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:09,154
That is what I really go by.

105
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:14,284
I was an exorcist, like Johan.

106
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:19,748
Out of all the priests
who received the mission back then,

107
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:21,666
I'm the only one who survived.

108
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:24,127
So…

109
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,465
This mission you speak of--

110
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:34,345
Our mission was to protect Tamra
from lust demons.

111
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,017
After surviving by myself,

112
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:45,440
protecting you,
who carried the power of Wonjeong,

113
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:48,026
has become my mission.

114
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,153
How could you…

115
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,991
How could you do this to me…

116
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,471
Didn't you feel bad?

117
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:22,560
Didn't you feel terrible
reaching out your hand to me?

118
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:26,397
I'm sorry. But--

119
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:27,524
Get out.

120
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,901
-Miss!
-Get out of my house right now.

121
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:33,905
Get out of my sight right now!

122
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,159
Won Mi-ho!

123
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,480
They all died because of you.

124
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,359
Everyone deceived me because of you.

125
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,530
My life is completely wrecked
because of you.

126
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,201
Didn't I tell you to protect Won Mi-ho?

127
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:05,413
There was a soul
that sincerely wanted to be saved.

128
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,707
If you have time to talk, find Gusunsae.

129
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:51,709
Won Mi-ho.

130
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,419
Won Mi-ho.

131
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:54,754
Where did Won Mi-ho go?

132
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:22,115
<i>Once the bowl is no more,</i>
<i>it will be the end for you, too, Wonjeong.</i>

133
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,411
<i>It might be better that way.</i>

134
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:29,622
<i>Now…</i>

135
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,001
<i>let's end it here.</i>

136
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:52,020
Wonjeong.

137
00:21:59,694 --> 00:22:00,820
Wonjeong!

138
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:14,208
This is my punishment to you.

139
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,586
Jongryeong!

140
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,755
I need to hear from Wonjeong herself.

141
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:57,168
Van…

142
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:11,974
It's okay.

143
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:44,507
<i>Miss, you were my only family</i>
<i>and life itself.</i>

144
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:45,967
<i>So…</i>

145
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:52,223
<i>I wanted to protect you.</i>

146
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:09,866
Father.

147
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:13,661
Why are you wearing a cassock…

148
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:16,747
There is nothing more I can do.

149
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:22,295
Until now,
I thought I was protecting Miss.

150
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:29,010
But I can no longer be
by her side like this.

151
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:30,636
What are you talking about now--

152
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,849
Father Johan, please protect Miss,
even if I won't be here.

153
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,393
-Father…
-I have to go to the diocese

154
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,354
and bring something back.

155
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:43,566
Father Chang.

156
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:54,076
I'll entrust you with my Miss until then.

157
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,070
I…

158
00:26:13,114 --> 00:26:14,782
met Wonjeong.

159
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:19,620
It wasn't your fault.

160
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:24,750
You were just trying
to protect her, right?

161
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,920
I couldn't protect her.

162
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:34,468
I…

163
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:39,473
I was the one who ended her life.

164
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:43,811
For a long time…

165
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,275
you were waiting alone, right?

166
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:52,403
That promise…

167
00:27:00,161 --> 00:27:01,162
I'm sorry.

168
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:04,373
I'm sorry.

169
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,295
I'm sorry that I am not her.

170
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:18,971
I'm not able to create the barrier.

171
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,725
I'm not able to save you either.

172
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:30,816
I'm sorry.

173
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,829
-Even though her memory returned…
-Don't cry.

174
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,665
She hasn't regained her power.

175
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:50,503
Was she merely a shell?

176
00:27:54,382 --> 00:27:56,675
Because of a mere shell like that…

177
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:03,015
until now, I have…

178
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,481
Gungtan.

179
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:18,989
To protect a mere shell like that,

180
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:23,494
you want to become
a disgusting and weak human?

181
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:28,332
Stop it.

182
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:31,419
That day was like hell for everyone.

183
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:33,087
-So, from now on--
-How dare you!

184
00:28:35,423 --> 00:28:37,341
You're nothing more than a shell.

185
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:42,072
It's pathetic to see you struggle.

186
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,200
Because I'm human.

187
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,962
I am desperate
because I am a vulnerable human.

188
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:04,678
I must save her so that I can live on too.

189
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:58,440
Mi-ho.

190
00:30:59,275 --> 00:31:00,568
Mi-ho! Mi-ho…

191
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:03,899
<i>The man in black…</i>

192
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:07,486
<i>was not Van.</i>

193
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:29,133
Are you okay?

194
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:32,803
Thank you.

195
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,723
I thought you weren't going to wake up.

196
00:33:40,978 --> 00:33:41,979
Won Mi-ho…

197
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:45,774
-Yes?
-Here…

198
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:50,320
I'm sorry.

199
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:11,800
Did you breastfeed your baby today?

200
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:24,146
Apparently, you must eat well
to make a lot of milk.

201
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:52,716
How are you feeling?

202
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:57,846
Before, you healed up quickly,
but it seems like it's getting slower.

203
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:08,398
It feels like we are
on a camping trip, right?

204
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,280
What's on your mind now?

205
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:22,120
I'm just thinking that this is nice.

206
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,128
Tell me honestly.

207
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,465
You injured your brain too, right?

208
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,595
Okay, let's say it was injured.

209
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,807
Actually, no. Let's say it wasn't.

210
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:57,197
There was something
I wanted to know for a while.

211
00:35:57,656 --> 00:36:01,451
I'm talking about that place
where the stone towers are stacked.

212
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:03,662
Right.

213
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:06,373
You should stay
at a more comfortable place.

214
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:07,708
Why do you stay there?

215
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:11,128
The place is comfortable for me.

216
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,008
It is my home
that has good and bad memories.

217
00:36:18,886 --> 00:36:22,139
Were the stone towers always there?

218
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:25,601
I started stacking them long ago.

219
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:28,478
There are so many. All by yourself?

220
00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:32,983
At the time, it was the only way
I could think of to atone for what I did.

221
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,204
The smoke…

222
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:56,673
If…

223
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:02,888
all the lust demons are gone,
what do you want to do then?

224
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:07,851
Well…

225
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:12,481
I've never lived in a world like that,
so I'm not sure.

226
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:22,407
If that's the case…
let's renew our contract.

227
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:24,451
How does it sound?

228
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:31,833
Well, being a protector is your forte,
so you should use your speciality

229
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:37,130
to protect something
that is rare, precious, and beautiful.

230
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:42,719
You know what I mean.

231
00:37:43,387 --> 00:37:45,722
Something precious is closer
than you think.

232
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:55,941
I think you are the one
with the brain injury.

233
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:06,410
Let's stay still without talking.

234
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:13,917
This is nice.

235
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:16,878
Isn't it?

236
00:38:27,431 --> 00:38:31,768
You said, "Let's stay still."
Why don't you keep your mouth still too?

237
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:36,106
You're getting better at talking.

238
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:04,718
Uncle, how did it go?
What about Ms. Won Mi-ho? Did she die?

239
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:30,470
Your lives will be completed
for my purpose.

240
00:43:33,028 --> 00:43:36,031
