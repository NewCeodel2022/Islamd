1
00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:23,607
ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS DEPICTED
IN THIS SERIES ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:25,985
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED SAFELY IN
THE PRESENCE OF THEIR GUARDIANS.

3
00:00:26,569 --> 00:00:29,113
Benjulle, Benjulle.

4
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:34,076
Whirl, whirl,
and come down to listen to my sorrows.

5
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,205
I dedicate these rites
to Benjulle with all my heart.

6
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:39,749
LEE SU-RYEON

7
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:41,375
Since long ago,

8
00:00:41,459 --> 00:00:44,503
weak women with no power

9
00:00:44,587 --> 00:00:49,383
had no one to lean on
even when suffering injustice.

10
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:53,512
Instead, they would seek
the spirit of Benjulle and prayed.

11
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:57,266
They believed that if they
placed something they possess and is clean

12
00:00:57,349 --> 00:01:02,813
onto the alter and prayed,
their stories will be seen and read

13
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:06,901
by the divine spirit of Benjulle.

14
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:08,694
Why are they holding onto paper?

15
00:01:08,778 --> 00:01:12,865
There were a lot of people
who were not literate.

16
00:01:13,324 --> 00:01:15,159
Instead of writing down their sorrows,

17
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:19,622
people believed holding onto something
they possess will convey their feelings.

18
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:23,459
However, in return for releasing
them of their sorrows,

19
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,503
they had to pay a price.

20
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:30,341
How did they pay the price?

21
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,177
They paid to the best of their ability.

22
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,764
Whether they were poor
or whether they were wealthy.

23
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:41,519
However, if a wealthy person
pays only a little,

24
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:45,397
Benjulle will think badly of it.

25
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:51,028
But... does Benjulle still exist?

26
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:54,782
Do you think Benjulle still exists?

27
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,618
I think Benjulle still exists.

28
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:04,166
I think he is still somewhere out there
helping out people who need it.

29
00:02:32,278 --> 00:02:35,239
{\an8}Mister, something smells great.

30
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,784
{\an8}Miss, you look like you're in a good mood.

31
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:42,913
{\an8}Yes, I am. I slept soundly today.

32
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,541
{\an8}That is good to hear.

33
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:51,380
{\an8}I was worried you might feel down
because it's your first day at work today.

34
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:56,844
{\an8}Right... I start work today.

35
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:05,144
{\an8}It's your first day today.
You should eat well.

36
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:06,854
{\an8}I lost my appetite.

37
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,440
{\an8}Mister.

38
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,026
{\an8}I hired a new bodyguard.

39
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:13,235
{\an8}A bodyguard?

40
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:17,197
The world is so rough.
Having someone by my side will be nice.

41
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:21,076
You should have talked to me about it.
We don't know if he is trustworthy.

42
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,579
As of now,
he is the most trustworthy person.

43
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,499
Please give him a spare room
and clean it up for him.

44
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,835
Get him some furniture
and things he might need.

45
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,962
He will be a residential bodyguard--

46
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:33,380
A residential bodyguard.

47
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:41,889
He is a trustworthy person,
so you don't have to worry.

48
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,599
Still, I should check up on him--

49
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:45,184
There he is.

50
00:03:52,358 --> 00:03:53,400
Mister.

51
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,324
This is my new bodyguard.

52
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:03,494
His name is just Van. This is Butler Jang.

53
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,378
Nice to meet you. I am...

54
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:25,766
As you may have noticed,
his social skills are a little lacking.

55
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,239
What are you doing here?
Are you not driving?

56
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,918
You are more than I thought.

57
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:56,505
How can you not know
how to drive at that age?

58
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,966
Is that guy from earlier someone you know?

59
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,050
Who?

60
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:01,510
Butler Jang?

61
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,056
I know him well. He is like family to me--

62
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:08,976
No, wait, I asked first!

63
00:05:10,436 --> 00:05:12,688
How do you go around hunting lust demons?

64
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:14,940
Do you just run around?

65
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,026
Look forward.

66
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,873
Since we signed the contract,
let's be honest now.

67
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:32,332
Who are you?

68
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,169
Do you have superpowers?

69
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:37,296
Can you fly around like Superman?

70
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:45,804
Do you have any friends or family?

71
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:50,517
Who am I talking to?

72
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:12,164
Don't run!

73
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:20,631
-Isn't this a Ferrari? It's Daehan Group!
-Hey, go inside.

74
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,431
Hello, Principal.

75
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:31,183
Why did you drive?

76
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,692
Who is this?
Is he someone in a high position?

77
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:42,027
He is my bodyguard.

78
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:43,112
I see...

79
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:44,905
A bodyguard.

80
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:50,536
I understand it may seem strange
for a school teacher to have a bodyguard.

81
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:53,038
But my situation right now
is a special case.

82
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:57,209
-I know you will understand.
-Of course, I understand.

83
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:58,335
Thank you.

84
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:06,885
It's this way.

85
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,112
Wait right here.

86
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:35,080
And use only the teacher's bathroom
which is on the first floor.

87
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:37,583
I'll order you lunch.
So, don't leave this room.

88
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,085
If a student comes in,
tell them to come back later.

89
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:42,504
If you meet any teachers,
act like you don't know.

90
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:45,549
If you feel like I am in need,
you must come right away, okay?

91
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:48,218
Why?

92
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,347
From now on, do not order me around

93
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:54,558
and do not move around
without my permission.

94
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:58,145
Permission and restraint.
Do that with your girlfriend.

95
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,606
Why do you think I hired you?

96
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,358
I want to safely live a normal daily life.

97
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:05,944
So wherever I go and whatever I do--

98
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,783
All you have to do is
follow me around, okay?

99
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:12,993
As you wish.

100
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:16,205
-Good.
-If it's your death wish, you do that.

101
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:18,624
Really?

102
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,168
How can a bodyguard threaten his employer?

103
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,050
Get some rest.

104
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,199
Hello.

105
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:58,372
Starting today,
I will be your teacher for this class.

106
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,124
My name is...

107
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,209
Won...

108
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,919
Mi-ho! Gu Mi-ho?

109
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:07,422
Won Mi-ho is informal.

110
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:09,383
Guys?

111
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:12,344
You should be calling me
as Won Mi-ho teacher.

112
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,513
Teacher, are you really a tycoon?

113
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:18,684
Since it's the first day,
I'll start by calling attendance.

114
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:20,269
Na Young-hwa?

115
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,562
Why did you come to Jeju Island?

116
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:26,733
Kwon Ji-eun?

117
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:27,859
Teacher!

118
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,445
Have you ever dated a celebrity?

119
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:33,115
Wow, a celebrity!

120
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,075
-Kim Hee-sub?
-Teacher!

121
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,035
Is Daehan Hotel all yours?

122
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:40,998
-Are you going to teach on your first day?
-No way! Of course she won't!

123
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,047
You...

124
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,721
There seem to be a lot of absentees.

125
00:09:57,723 --> 00:10:01,727
Students who do not answer
will now be penalized.

126
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,312
Put your phones down now.

127
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,982
Lee Su-ryeon?

128
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,943
Lee Su-ryeon?

129
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:12,321
Do you not care if you are penalized?

130
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:14,239
Su-ryeon did not come to school today.

131
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:16,700
Hey you, stop right there.

132
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,243
What are you doing?

133
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,245
I'm skipping class.

134
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:21,371
What? Hey!

135
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:24,541
-Hey!
-Penalize me as you please.

136
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:31,006
How can a student skip class so bluntly?

137
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,468
-Who is she?
-Boo Yeom-ji.

138
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,430
Boo...Yeom-ji?

139
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,893
She has a very...

140
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,355
clear sense of values.

141
00:10:58,033 --> 00:10:59,242
Su-ryeon, it's me.

142
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:28,522
Su-ryeon, something interesting
happened at school today.

143
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:31,775
You know Won Mi-ho, right?
The only daughter of Daehan Group.

144
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,194
She came to our school as a teacher.

145
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,699
Are you not going to
continue coming to school?

146
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:45,831
I should not get out of here.

147
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:49,126
I can not get out.

148
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,555
Did that guy do this? Am I right?

149
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:06,435
Why are you going out with a guy like him?
Break up with him immediately!

150
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,311
I tried to break up with him.

151
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:13,150
Su-ryeon.

152
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,651
You sing a song too.

153
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,571
It's okay. You can keep singing.

154
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:24,035
Hey, why are you so naive?

155
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:25,412
Hey...

156
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:27,956
Why did you do that then?

157
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:29,624
What did I do?

158
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,294
Last time at Woljeong-ri cafe.

159
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:36,506
Oh, the bad guy back then?

160
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:40,385
Hey, it's what I had to do.
That perverted bastard.

161
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:43,472
He had nothing better to do than
to look at another girl's legs.

162
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,391
Thinking about that time
makes me angry again.

163
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:48,602
I should have just killed him that time.

164
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:54,941
Not the reason... The wall.

165
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,276
The wall?

166
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,362
Oh, that?

167
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:04,784
That is because...

168
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:09,247
even when you are hitting someone,
there are things you need to keep in mind.

169
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:10,415
For example,

170
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:15,337
there should be no plan or weapons used.

171
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,717
You must hit fairly.

172
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,512
To avoid additional punishment.

173
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:28,642
So, if there's a person you want to beat,

174
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:38,026
grab the bastard's face and
scrape his face on the wall or the floor.

175
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:41,738
And that is enough.

176
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,492
That is the most efficient way.

177
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:49,496
The scar will go on for a long time.

178
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,426
What is it?

179
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:09,683
Is Su-ryeon recording something?

180
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:12,310
That's not it...

181
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,815
I recall explaining
to you fully well last time.

182
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,155
I guess it was not enough.

183
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:27,951
No...

184
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,035
It's okay.

185
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,372
I can take my time to look into it.

186
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,830
It's okay.
You don't need the recording.

187
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,207
He must have
sent you messages or something.

188
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,543
There's nothing...

189
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:21,630
Absolutely nothing.

190
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:24,174
Why not?

191
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,561
What should I do?

192
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:39,147
Yeom-ji, what should I do?

193
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:43,109
You can talk to someone.

194
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:46,863
Whether it's your parents or the police,
as long as we tell someone...

195
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,658
Su-ryeon, look at me.

196
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,910
Look at me. I will go with you.

197
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,204
-I will help you talk.
-No!

198
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:57,999
-I will get killed! He will kill me!
-Stop talking nonsense!

199
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,376
You saw him too!

200
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:03,421
Whether he kills me, or me killing myself
if those photos get exposed,

201
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:04,547
I will die anyways.

202
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:05,840
No.

203
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:07,384
You will not die.

204
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,844
-So get up.
-No!

205
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:12,305
-Get up!
-No, don't do this to me!

206
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:14,766
Please, don't be like this!

207
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,686
GYEONG-JUN

208
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:22,607
Yes, Gyeong-jun.

209
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,151
I picked up the phone.

210
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:27,779
What do you mean? I'm home.

211
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,449
Of course. I miss you too.

212
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,785
<i>Are you with someone?</i>

213
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:35,245
What?

214
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:39,791
<i>Did you not hear me?</i>
<i>I asked if you are with someone.</i>

215
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,137
No.

216
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:56,975
<i>Okay.</i>

217
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,979
Yeom-ji, you should hurry out now.

218
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:02,731
Please, leave now!

219
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,113
Su-ryeon...

220
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:18,079
I told you to get lost!

221
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,879
Su-ryeon! Lee Su-ryeon!

222
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:37,724
You scared me!

223
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:40,602
Boo Yeom-ji?

224
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:44,230
What's up with you?

225
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:46,441
Are you going to
skip the first class today?

226
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:49,861
I want to consult with you.
It is important.

227
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:53,198
I am not ready to
consult with anyone right now.

228
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:55,658
So come next time, okay?

229
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:04,167
Teacher, I thought you caused trouble
and came down to self-reflect.

230
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,169
Student Boo Yeom-ji?

231
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:10,423
-Between student and teacher--
-But you're not a teacher.

232
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:12,300
You are just acting like a teacher.

233
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:13,968
What did you say?

234
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,971
Teacher, that is why I must talk with you.

235
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,645
I'm sorry to tell you this.

236
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:27,023
You might be right about me
acting as a teacher.

237
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,067
But I'm formally a teacher here for now.

238
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,111
I don't have time for people
who is pretending to be a student.

239
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:36,449
-The door is open.
-Su-ryeon.

240
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:39,577
Lee Su-ryeon is in our class.

241
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:41,538
She was absent for several days now.

242
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:43,915
Lee Su-ryeon?

243
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,045
She wasn't absent just yesterday?

244
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,674
Her boyfriend is stalking her.
She has been getting abused for a while.

245
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,178
Go to the police.
Why did you come to me?

246
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:58,513
There is no hard evidence.

247
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:00,390
What do you mean?

248
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,183
I cannot go into the details.

249
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,060
Anyways, there is a situation.

250
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:08,231
Teachers don't care about matters
that occur outside of school.

251
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:11,276
Calling the police
might make matters worse.

252
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,529
You are Daehan Group's sole daughter.

253
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:17,490
Don't you have the power
to get rid of anyone?

254
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:18,700
What?

255
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:24,080
It is not something
that I can do as I please.

256
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:31,462
So tell the police the important details.

257
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:32,589
Go to class.

258
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:08,416
I can't tell if you are
here to eat or here to drink.

259
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,084
Elder...

260
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,337
Can you not remember me?

261
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:15,882
Never mind, you already drank.

262
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:18,259
I am working for Won Mi-ho.

263
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:20,470
I guess Wonjeong would be more exact.

264
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,936
You... the young priest back then?

265
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:44,911
Father Choi...
Please, come back to your senses.

266
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:49,290
Father Choi!

267
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:03,137
Lust demons are not something
you humans can handle.

268
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:05,390
If you want to live...

269
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:08,393
run away from this land as far as you can.

270
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:25,493
After searching for the lust demon,

271
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:28,579
I thought you died
because you did not return.

272
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:29,956
Van...

273
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:32,000
He saved me.

274
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:35,461
I see.

275
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:40,174
But why do you seem so terrified?

276
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:44,012
Van is with the lady.

277
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:46,931
Were you already aware?

278
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:51,060
Are you scared of Van?

279
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:53,062
He is not human.

280
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:56,607
That is why he is able
to fight the evil lust demons.

281
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:58,317
You know better.

282
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:02,030
I am afraid he might hurt
the lady once again.

283
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:05,033
But he is the only person
that can protect her too.

284
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:08,369
If it wasn't for Van,
she would have died already.

285
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:12,081
Are you telling me to trust him?

286
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:16,586
Rather than trusting Van,
trust in his guilt.

287
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,843
Why are you still afraid
even after witnessing him yourself?

288
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,054
Priest, listen to me.

289
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:29,223
Whether it's Van or the lady,
or you and I.

290
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:32,226
We are all entangled
in the chains of fate.

291
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:37,440
We are just preparing for the day to come
from our respective places.

292
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:41,110
When the time comes, I will do so too.

293
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:54,999
Come to think of it, I made a mistake.

294
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,628
The benefit of an employment contract
is the money deposit.

295
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:02,006
Mister.

296
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:16,938
Don't be too surprised.

297
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:18,940
Get my permission
before going somewhere.

298
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,444
Here.

299
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:30,660
Wear new clothes starting tomorrow.

300
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:33,830
Mister, please show him his room.

301
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:35,373
Okay.

302
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:37,917
Follow me.

303
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:52,974
Of course.

304
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:55,059
Money controls everything.

305
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:57,854
This is great!

306
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:30,636
Due to the short notice,
I was not able to prepare a nicer room.

307
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,805
It is not much, but for now--

308
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:36,726
Did you lose your memory due to age?
Or did you just become fearless?

309
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:41,397
I warned you to run away
because there is nothing you can do.

310
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:43,900
There is something I must protect.

311
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,862
I met Geum Baek-ju earlier.

312
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,531
I decided to put my trust in you.

313
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:56,287
Should I be thanking you?

314
00:24:57,455 --> 00:25:00,208
Stopping lust demons
as a human is not possible.

315
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:04,045
Let's just say we are borrowing
your powers for the time being.

316
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:09,217
As always, you foolishly trust anyone.

317
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:13,471
Miss Won Mi-ho...
please take good care of her.

318
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:21,854
Won Mi-ho?

319
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,442
She should've been
called Wonjeong by now...

320
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,111
if it wasn't for your lazy actions.

321
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:35,117
Where are you going?

322
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:05,708
<i>Su-ryeon.</i>

323
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:08,669
<i>Have you heard about Benjulle?</i>

324
00:27:15,343 --> 00:27:16,761
<i>For a long time...</i>

325
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:20,973
<i>It is a spirit that has dwelled</i>
<i>at the sacred tree of Bonhyangdang.</i>

326
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:24,810
<i>It listens to people's sorrows</i>
<i>and releases you from them.</i>

327
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:56,926
<i>Benjulle, Benjulle.</i>

328
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:05,559
Whirl, whirl,
and come down to listen to my sorrows.

329
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,646
I dedicate these rites to the alter...

330
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,525
to Benjulle with all my heart.

331
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:17,131
Right hand deeper!

332
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,512
Right hand deeper!

333
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:58,964
I should have let you know earlier.

334
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:02,593
I'm sorry, Miss.

335
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:06,597
I didn't know you had
such a grown-up nephew.

336
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:10,518
Your name is... Johan?

337
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:13,187
Yes, my Korean name is Kang Chan-hyeok.

338
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,813
You're talking informally to me.

339
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:17,525
After seeing you,
I assumed you were younger than me.

340
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:19,360
This guy...

341
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:21,820
Can I just call you Mi-ho, like a friend?

342
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:23,614
No, you cannot.

343
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:25,115
Okay.

344
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:28,786
Feel free to call me Johan.

345
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:30,079
Johan.

346
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:34,208
He used to live in Italy
and returned due to an emergency.

347
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:37,169
There is no one else to look after him.

348
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:39,088
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

349
00:30:39,797 --> 00:30:41,006
Make yourself at home.

350
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:43,759
But you know who I am, right?

351
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:44,843
Yes.

352
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:49,306
I studied Korean through the news in Italy
and I saw you a lot there.

353
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:50,975
For causing trouble.

354
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:53,477
What?

355
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:56,772
Your flip technique
was executed perfectly.

356
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:02,528
Look at this him!

357
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:05,030
I'm starting to like this guy.

358
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:08,909
Mister, not this one.
Please bring and open the good wine.

359
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:10,911
-Okay?
-Sure.

360
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:13,289
Yes, Miss.

361
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:26,844
What are you doing?

362
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:31,724
I'm under a lot of stress.

363
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:34,310
Can I leave Jeju Island now?

364
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,147
I feel like I am cursed with Jeju Island.

365
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,316
Johan, I really hate it here.

366
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:41,650
Me too.

367
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:46,447
If it makes you have a hard time,
I hate it here too!

368
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,324
Johan.

369
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:50,951
Do you feel loved?

370
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:57,207
I am giving my love
and also receiving love.

371
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:58,584
By whom?

372
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:01,545
By God.

373
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,589
God?

374
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:06,675
I envy you.

375
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,595
Should I tell you a secret?

376
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:15,976
I am receiving love as well.

377
00:32:18,354 --> 00:32:19,480
By whom?

378
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:22,358
God... Ghosts.

379
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,945
They love me so much.

380
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:30,199
They can't stop coming to me
to engulf me in their love.

381
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:31,283
Those bastards...

382
00:32:31,742 --> 00:32:33,744
Johan, listen to me.

383
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:37,289
I thought my life could only be so harsh.

384
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,375
Day-to-day incidents,

385
00:32:40,501 --> 00:32:43,545
family issues regarding authority rights,

386
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:45,673
is what I thought to be
as harsh as it gets.

387
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:47,466
But as it turns out,

388
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:48,884
my life became...

389
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:55,641
an SF, fantasy, blockbuster,
plus exorcist action!

390
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:57,101
It was an exorcism.

391
00:32:57,768 --> 00:32:58,936
Are you listening to me?

392
00:32:59,353 --> 00:33:01,814
-I'm talking to you.
-Yes, exorcism.

393
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:06,568
But what gets me angry

394
00:33:07,236 --> 00:33:10,280
is that the only being
that is able to protect me,

395
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:14,535
does not understand my words and feelings
as well as having no common sense!

396
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:16,120
No.

397
00:33:16,537 --> 00:33:20,833
He wrote a contract to protect me
and even took my money.

398
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,543
But where is he now?

399
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,044
Van!

400
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:27,881
This bastard, I'm going to go find him.

401
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:38,350
He was here!

402
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:43,731
You look like a poisonous mushroom.

403
00:33:44,982 --> 00:33:46,108
What?

404
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:50,154
Your face is so yellow.

405
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:53,365
You look yellow because
you always wear dark clothes.

406
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:55,159
Do you have only one set of clothes?

407
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,123
That hurt!

408
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:05,085
This poisonous mushroom bastard...

409
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:13,635
Don't go. Don't leave me.

410
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:37,826
You are like a father.

411
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:40,913
Who was the man in the black suit?

412
00:34:47,044 --> 00:34:49,296
He is... Van.

413
00:35:00,307 --> 00:35:01,391
Wow.

414
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,144
I never thought I'd meet you like this.

415
00:35:05,813 --> 00:35:07,815
I didn't know I'd meet you this quickly.

416
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:13,153
I only thought of you as someone
who is in the prophecies.

417
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:19,535
How old are you then?

418
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,495
What should I call you?

419
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:23,372
Older brother?

420
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:24,706
Uncle?

421
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:27,960
Or... grandpa?

422
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:32,965
Well, that's not important.

423
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:39,137
But... most of the demons
I know are usually talkative.

424
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:42,933
I know you are a half-demon.

425
00:35:44,393 --> 00:35:46,979
These dark clothes and black hair...

426
00:35:48,397 --> 00:35:50,357
Knife. Where's your knife?

427
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:53,569
Is it in your jacket?
Or in your pocket?

428
00:35:54,111 --> 00:35:55,988
It can get stuck in your neck.

429
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,161
How can you say such a terrifying remark
in such a cute manner?

430
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:04,955
Your eyes are so pure and clear.

431
00:36:07,249 --> 00:36:08,292
The way I see it...

432
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:11,169
You look like a child with many sorrows.

433
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:13,297
Maybe that's why...

434
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:19,803
you smell a bit.

435
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:21,680
The smell of blood.

436
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:26,226
No matter how much you try to act human,
you cannot hide it.

437
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:31,189
You are a lust demon.

438
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:37,988
Humans always try to know everything
because they fear the unknown.

439
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:44,703
So don't try too hard.

440
00:36:46,747 --> 00:36:48,081
I can see right through you.

441
00:36:57,341 --> 00:37:00,802
<i>Meeting him can turn excitement into fear.</i>

442
00:37:37,798 --> 00:37:39,132
What is he doing?

443
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,428
He looks very holy.

444
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:55,357
Hey.

445
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:57,943
Hey, did you sleep well?

446
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:02,447
You... Are you really a priest...

447
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:04,950
...sir?

448
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:10,747
Then the god that you said you love
and receive love... is it up here?

449
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:12,374
Amen.

450
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:15,502
I'm sorry.

451
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:16,586
About what?

452
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:19,381
I dared to compare your god with my ghost.

453
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:21,591
I'm going to end up in hell.

454
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:23,802
No way. What do you mean?

455
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:25,762
He has everything in mind.

456
00:38:25,846 --> 00:38:28,432
I will put in a good word for you.

457
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:29,808
No.

458
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:31,768
I'm going to die anyways.

459
00:38:31,852 --> 00:38:35,188
Shall we start with the Confession?
Or shall we get some hangover food?

460
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:40,485
Where is he off to again?

461
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,493
That scared me!

462
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:50,412
Wow.

463
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:54,124
When did you get on?

464
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:56,043
Mi-ho!

465
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,798
Why are you getting on?

466
00:39:01,882 --> 00:39:03,800
I was getting bored.

467
00:39:03,884 --> 00:39:06,762
I thought something interesting
might occur if I follow you.

468
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:10,390
I'm not going out to have fun.

469
00:39:10,474 --> 00:39:12,059
I'm going out to play.

470
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:18,482
You might be in danger.

471
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:26,990
But how much longer do I have to drive?

472
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:37,417
Are you the CEO?

473
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:39,711
Drive.

474
00:39:57,187 --> 00:40:00,982
Is he that spoiled?
He can't even drive at that age?

475
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:12,744
Stop the car.

476
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:18,166
-What? There's no place to stop here.
-Stop the car right now!

477
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:29,386
Why?

478
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:31,555
What's wrong? Did something appear again?

479
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:34,474
Where are you going?
You have to protect me!

480
00:40:36,226 --> 00:40:38,061
This is a violation of the contract!

481
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:44,568
This is so frustrating.

482
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:48,530
I am the employer.
But why is he acting like the employer?

483
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:52,200
He does seem like a jerk.

484
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,538
But don't worry.

485
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,166
I know how to bodyguard too.

486
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,293
With what, your prayers?

487
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:02,794
What do you take me for?

488
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,671
With my faith!

489
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:06,840
With hope?

490
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:12,470
Was she expecting love?

491
00:41:15,432 --> 00:41:16,433
Get on.

492
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:32,407
-Hey, get on.
-Wow.

493
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,743
It's fine, it's right there.

494
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,036
Hello.

495
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:38,872
Wow, you are very handsome.

496
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:40,957
I hear that often.

497
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:43,043
I'm sure you have.

498
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,337
Nice to meet you!

499
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,005
I am Mi-ho's friend, Su-jin.

500
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:48,298
My name is Johan.

501
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:51,259
Look at those long fingers.
It's totally my style.

502
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:54,679
Su-jin. Does your boyfriend know
you are acting like this?

503
00:41:54,763 --> 00:41:56,389
If he knew, would I be acting like this?

504
00:41:56,473 --> 00:41:58,433
-Move your hand so we can go.
-Let's go.

505
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:01,228
You said it's right there.
I'll be going now.

506
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:04,814
Why are you leaving her?
You should have let her on.

507
00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:06,191
Do you want to get off too?

508
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,693
The weather is nice today.

509
00:42:16,076 --> 00:42:17,118
-Hey.
-Are you okay?

510
00:42:17,953 --> 00:42:19,913
-Boo Yeom-ji?
-Teacher...

511
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:21,581
Are you okay?

512
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:25,585
Teacher, please save me.

513
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:41,810
<i>She must have made a wish... to Benjulle.</i>

514
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,191
Benjulle... what?

515
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,194
What is that? Is that a term kids use?

516
00:42:51,695 --> 00:42:52,779
Benjulle.

517
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:55,991
It's a spirit that listens and relieves
people from their sorrows.

518
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,412
Since adults do not listen,

519
00:43:02,414 --> 00:43:05,000
it was for her to have
at least something to lean on.

520
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:09,546
Okay.

521
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:12,048
I'm still not sure what Benjulle is,

522
00:43:12,132 --> 00:43:15,176
but you are saying that something is wrong
with Su-ryeon, right?

523
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:21,266
-Then after class, I will call Su-ryeon--
-It will be too late!

524
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:25,186
-We should not be late.
-What's wrong with you too?

525
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:29,441
Have a seat.

526
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:36,364
I'm sure you don't know.

527
00:43:37,157 --> 00:43:39,326
Because you never
had to ask someone for help

528
00:43:40,452 --> 00:43:42,329
or ask someone to believe you.

529
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,627
I have a situation too...

530
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:54,507
Let's stop by home before we go.
I have something to bring.

531
00:44:10,607 --> 00:44:11,608
We are here now.

532
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:22,327
Okay, then you should go home now.

533
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:24,329
No, I want to come along.

534
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:27,082
The adults will take care of this.
Leave now.

535
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:53,483
The door is open.

536
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:04,119
Is anybody inside?

537
00:45:07,539 --> 00:45:08,665
Who are you?

538
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:48,455
You are Su-ryeon's mother, right?

539
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:50,707
I am Su-ryeon's teacher at school.

540
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:53,918
Well, that's...

541
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:55,336
I'm sorry...

542
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,046
I could not send her to school.

543
00:45:57,422 --> 00:45:58,465
But...

544
00:46:00,008 --> 00:46:01,968
would you like to come inside for a bit?

545
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:05,346
The house is very messy, right?

546
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,849
She's become very strange all of a sudden.

547
00:46:09,309 --> 00:46:10,768
She's become rabid.

548
00:46:11,311 --> 00:46:14,230
The glass is dangerous. Just come up.

549
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:15,690
Okay.

550
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:20,236
She does not go to school
and only stays inside her room.

551
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,572
I have no idea why she is like this.

552
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,242
Where is Su-ryeon right now?

553
00:46:26,326 --> 00:46:27,785
The second floor, in her room.

554
00:46:28,995 --> 00:46:31,456
-Come this way.
-Ma'am.

555
00:46:32,332 --> 00:46:34,751
You should not come up and stay down here.

556
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:36,878
What?

557
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:40,340
A priest accompanied me,
so we will go up together.

558
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:42,884
Okay, I understand.

559
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:16,251
My goodness!

560
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:19,837
Go first.

561
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:26,928
Hey, shouldn't we call someone for help?

562
00:47:27,804 --> 00:47:29,180
That help is right here.

563
00:47:30,557 --> 00:47:32,475
What? How are you so calm?

564
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:34,936
I told you I have a weapon too.

565
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:37,939
A weapon? What kind of weapon?

566
00:47:38,815 --> 00:47:39,857
What?

567
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:41,401
Faith.

568
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:46,406
Which room is it?

569
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:55,540
Why is the door opening on its own?

570
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:09,846
Su-ryeon!

571
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:22,191
Su-ryeon.

572
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:25,069
Su-ryeon?

573
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:27,989
Are you asleep?

574
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:33,661
Let's have a chat for a second.

575
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:35,288
Su-ryeon?

576
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:39,876
What's going on? She seems too calm.

577
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:55,016
Lee Soo-ryeon!

578
00:48:56,768 --> 00:48:57,852
Hold on.

579
00:48:58,561 --> 00:48:59,604
Mi-ho, this...

580
00:49:01,022 --> 00:49:02,023
Why?

581
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,707
Hey!
She is being possessed by a ghost, right?

582
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:21,084
Tie her up.

583
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:24,045
-What is this?
-Quick! There is no time!

584
00:49:46,401 --> 00:49:51,155
You're the shield that surrounds me, Lord,
and I cry out to you with a loud voice...

585
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:52,824
Answer me from the holy mountain!

586
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:58,579
You are the shield that surrounds me.
I cry out to you with a loud voice...

587
00:49:58,663 --> 00:50:01,374
Please, answer me from the holy mountain!

588
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:05,211
In the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit.

589
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,446
I got you.

590
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:25,750
