1
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,360
All characters and events depicted
in this series are fictitious.

2
00:00:23,441 --> 00:00:25,321
Child actors were filmed safely in
the presence of their guardians.

3
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:36,002
There once was a time when all beings
used to live in harmony in the land,

4
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:37,078
Tamra.

5
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:40,961
But the harmony did not go long.

6
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:45,421
Chaos emerged as gods and beings clashed.

7
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:49,176
A newcomer watched on from the beginning.

8
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:54,350
The 46 children of god
had their blood sealed away.

9
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,680
As a result, the chaos subsided.

10
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:03,654
In order to stop the monsters
from coming out of this Hell's Gate,

11
00:01:04,023 --> 00:01:07,403
the god made each of its 46 children
into a Dol Hareubang,

12
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,070
and blocked off the Gate.

13
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:12,779
That is how the Dol Hareubang
appeared on Jeju Island.

14
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:15,985
But why are there more than 46?

15
00:01:16,327 --> 00:01:21,247
In order to hide the 46,
the god made many fakes to disguise it.

16
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,962
-That's why there's a lot of it.
-Photographer!

17
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:25,213
Are we there yet?

18
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,456
We are almost there.
Just a little more to go.

19
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,803
The groom seems weaker than he looks!

20
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:33,974
Tonight will be your first night together.

21
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:36,512
Will you be able to do it?

22
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,850
What's wrong? Are you having a hard time?

23
00:01:40,476 --> 00:01:42,096
My hobby is mountain climbing.

24
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,937
-It seems like you like it.
-Is that it?

25
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,566
Look at this.

26
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:53,066
This… Dol Hareubang.

27
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:54,824
Are you listening to me?

28
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,582
This…

29
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:59,949
The Dol Hareubangs should not be
like this, side to side.

30
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:01,214
Wow!

31
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:03,044
This place is amazing.

32
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,123
This is good.

33
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,838
These Dol Hareubang statues,

34
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:10,207
being together side by side
is extremely rare to find.

35
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:13,047
Yes. The Dol Hareubang on the right…

36
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,391
That moss…
why is there spring moss when it's autumn?

37
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,484
Honey.

38
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:24,187
I heard if you touch its nose,
you'll get a son.

39
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,310
Oh, really?

40
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,857
You guys love it!
I knew you guys would love it here.

41
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:31,244
Excuse me.

42
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:32,358
Please get ready now.

43
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:36,238
I really should hire an assistant.

44
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,913
It's difficult doing all of this alone.

45
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:41,786
Honey.

46
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,869
These Dol Hareubangs…

47
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,246
Don't you feel a strange energy from it?

48
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:50,384
It feels like… it is very powerful.

49
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:54,879
Let's change our shoes.

50
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:02,636
Honestly, thinking about it makes me sad.

51
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:07,728
Not just one or two children.
All of the children into Dol Hareubangs…

52
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:11,033
The feelings of the mother
who needed to close the Gate.

53
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:16,034
That is why I always tell this legend
to the people who come up here.

54
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:19,778
Man, I told them to fix this.
It is still broken.

55
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:22,999
What's happening?

56
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:24,787
What was that?

57
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:26,674
Did you do something?

58
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:51,234
Let's see here…

59
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,740
Groom?

60
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,254
Bride?

61
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:08,174
Where did they go?

62
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:11,541
What is this?

63
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:17,048
Why is it…

64
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,012
What is this?

65
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,274
I've never seen this before.

66
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:36,817
You scared me!

67
00:04:37,403 --> 00:04:41,033
Where did you go?
You should tell me before you go anywhere.

68
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:42,703
Are you hurt somewhere?

69
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:21,052
Go get Giovanni.

70
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,720
Yes, Father.

71
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,726
You… a dead man breathing fine.

72
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,570
You were abandoned by your parents, right?

73
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:43,611
Do you know why?

74
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,534
Because… your mother was a whore!

75
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,870
Chan-hyeok, I still live in hell…

76
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:55,169
But you're so easygoing.

77
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,337
It's so dark here.

78
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,383
There is a strange smell.

79
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:03,973
Let me live!

80
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,968
Save me! Take these off!

81
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:10,386
Release me now!

82
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,471
Okay, hold on.

83
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:16,229
It is all ready now. Wait a little more.

84
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,810
Let's start off with this.

85
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,161
Damn you…

86
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:31,081
Leave me alone! Release me!

87
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,455
Damn you, you bastard!

88
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,250
You son of a whore!

89
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:43,464
Get away from me!

90
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,177
Father Giovanni!

91
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:05,492
Father Giovanni, there is a big issue.

92
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,688
Who is this woman in the white robe?

93
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,272
A long time ago,
there was a time when the world

94
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,398
almost became engulfed
by the power of evil.

95
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,240
This woman…

96
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,621
She was the only hope and savior

97
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,829
for the balance and protection
of this world.

98
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,950
The savior?

99
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:00,826
Sadly,
she couldn't fulfill her mission and died.

100
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:07,093
The man in the black robe killed her.
Am I right?

101
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,879
Yes.

102
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:14,389
This man did not die
and is still alive and well.

103
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:17,387
He is somewhere on the island.

104
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:19,015
So he is not human…

105
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:20,516
Giovanni.

106
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:27,815
This is a sign that the world will be
endangered again by evil beings.

107
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,321
Is there any way to stop him?

108
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:32,573
Long ago, we found a new savior.

109
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:35,446
We have been watching over her ever since.

110
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:36,544
Is that so?

111
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,208
Look here.

112
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:50,006
Is it this woman?

113
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:54,592
Fate will lead her back to the island.

114
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:57,259
Giovanni…

115
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,099
Giovanni, go there.

116
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:06,815
Go there and help her
to save the world from crisis.

117
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,949
This is the will of the Lord.

118
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:16,703
-Amen.
-Amen.

119
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:26,794
As if it is trying to wash away
all of the stains and dirt…

120
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:31,717
Can you see the scenery
of this majestic cascading waterfall?

121
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:34,973
-A unique and dynamic expression--
-Chairman?

122
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,175
-I have a question.
-Reporter…

123
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:38,972
There's time for questions later--

124
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:42,846
I heard Daehan Group has spent a lot
in order to open this collection.

125
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:44,438
How much is that exactly?

126
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:49,864
As you may know,

127
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:54,147
an artist's painting
is not about the price tag.

128
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:56,778
Please,
just consider only the value of the work.

129
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,785
I heard other than this artist's artwork,

130
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,948
famous artist's pieces were also bought
counting up to 100 pieces.

131
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:06,038
Is it true that this is used for
Daehan Group's slush fund?

132
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,331
Hold on, sir.

133
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,630
Those artworks.
Every single one of them…

134
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:14,045
will be displayed
in all of the rooms in Daehan Hotel.

135
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:17,264
We plan to allow all customers
during their stay at the hotel

136
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:20,014
to be able to freely
appreciate and enjoy the paintings

137
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:22,137
without any sort of restrictions.

138
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,980
Do you mean those expensive paintings?

139
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,440
Using those expensive paintings
to provide the best service to customers

140
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,192
is Daehan Hotel's ultimate goal.

141
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,147
You're Reporter Choi
from Jinmyung Daily, right?

142
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:36,659
Looking at your SNS,
it seems you often stay at our hotel.

143
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,118
If there is a painting you like,
please let me know.

144
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:48,578
Miss, you did a great job today.

145
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:51,127
I did the hard work today
stopping the reporters.

146
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,211
You did well.

147
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,383
Why didn't you come?

148
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:57,554
You are doing well alone
without this old man.

149
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,394
Of course I do well!

150
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,349
I still feel uneasy without you.

151
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,770
Why would you feel uneasy
when I am here?

152
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:06,061
I am nearing retirement age.

153
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,944
These days,
many people get employed after retirement.

154
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,521
-No.
-Why not?

155
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:12,606
It's tiring.

156
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,742
I also have a life plan.

157
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,866
I will go to Jeju Island
and start a Hallabong farm.

158
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:23,328
Farm in Seoul.
I will build you a significant arboretum.

159
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:25,872
Hallabongs taste the best
at Halla Mountain--

160
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:27,214
Sir!

161
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:45,636
Who do you think I am?

162
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,144
We will leave you two to talk.

163
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:51,937
Let's go.

164
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:57,651
I still have food left…

165
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,741
How did you know I was here?

166
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,406
I'm impressed you found me.

167
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:09,205
-I asked, who do you think I am?
-My aunt.

168
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,535
Yes. I am your aunt.

169
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:16,842
I am your aunt as well as
Daehan Hotel's owner.

170
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,382
But despite me being the owner,

171
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:21,175
why do I hear news
about my hotel through articles?

172
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,179
Thanks to my smart nephew.

173
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,720
I know, right?

174
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,564
-I wish I didn't know better too.
-What?

175
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,731
17% negative growth last year.

176
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,849
22% negative growth this year.

177
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:33,897
5th place in the domestic hotel rankings.

178
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:38,191
Daehan Hotel is the only hotel
that has a negative growth rate each year.

179
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:42,026
I'm too worried to leave it alone.

180
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:43,113
Hey.

181
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:46,543
If anyone is to worry, it is me.
It is my hotel.

182
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:50,865
My aunt… No, wait.

183
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,290
Daehan Hotel's owner must have forgotten.

184
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:56,673
40% of Daehan's shares
belong to Daehan Group.

185
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:59,593
25% belongs to my father
and you have 17% of the shares.

186
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:01,375
And I…

187
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,635
I almost forgot…

188
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,928
-18%--
-Are you really doing this to your aunt?

189
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,933
I'm the only daughter and successor
of the CEO, Won Tae-han.

190
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:13,096
It's not wrong for me to check up
on the groups in advance, right?

191
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,226
Mi-ho.

192
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,114
Just mess up one time.

193
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:19,152
Not twice, but only just once.

194
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,193
I will be waiting.

195
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,321
I won't be far.

196
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,407
Secretary Kang, go to the art museum.

197
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,327
What? The art museum at this time?

198
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,419
Shall I take the local route then?

199
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,306
-What was that?
-Are you okay?

200
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:56,943
Damn it, what's up with the lousy driving?

201
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,820
I can't believe this.

202
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:06,989
Step out of the car.

203
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,447
What's wrong with your driving?

204
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,419
Damn it, are you driving with your feet?

205
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:20,999
Wait, you sped in to change lanes.

206
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:24,672
Obviously, you failed
to maintain a safe distance.

207
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:26,545
What will you do about this?

208
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:30,684
Let's call car insurance.

209
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,314
What?

210
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:34,888
Are you saying this wasn't your fault?

211
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:39,060
No… both parties' fault?

212
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:40,437
What did you say?

213
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:42,398
Say it again!

214
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,111
Secretary Kang!

215
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:49,365
I apologize.

216
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,751
That's not how this should go.

217
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,828
The person who drove
should be apologizing.

218
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:59,081
Why should someone
who is not involved be apologizing?

219
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,634
I can't believe you guys.

220
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,801
-You merged in recklessly--
-Secretary Kang.

221
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,174
Apologize to them.

222
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:09,718
I'm sorry.

223
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,140
Where's your bow?

224
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:16,846
-I'm sorry.
-You're not bowing down enough.

225
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,227
You should bow down like this!

226
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:22,521
You should stop this now.

227
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,527
I'm only doing this to finish this.

228
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:27,449
It's your fault
for not disciplining your employee well.

229
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:42,497
Car repair fees and hospital bills…
I will send it to you once you request it.

230
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:45,054
Secretary Kang. Give them a business card.

231
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,263
Okay.

232
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:50,838
Did you record it well?

233
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:55,434
What are you guys doing?

234
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:57,064
Get on quickly!

235
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:02,019
Hey!

236
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,070
A third-generation chaebol
assaulting people was caught on video…

237
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:07,781
The perpetrator was revealed to be

238
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,491
Won Mi-ho, the most potential heir

239
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:11,951
and daughter of CEO Won Tae-han
of Daehan Group.

240
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:15,663
The media and public are showing
strong criticism and are boycotting…

241
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:17,874
The stock market mood
surrounding Daehan Group

242
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:21,214
is seen to be unfavorable after
the recording and news were released.

243
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,461
Daehan Group's shareholders
called for an emergency meeting

244
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:28,214
despite the regular general meeting
that was scheduled for three weeks later.

245
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:29,918
Aunt, is this your work?

246
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:32,342
I'm disappointed.

247
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:34,347
Do you think I would do that obviously?

248
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:37,926
I just figured you had
a lot of enemies here and there.

249
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:42,194
Aunt, you sound very excited.

250
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,978
Maybe it's because I didn't get any sleep.

251
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,228
Hey, go inside now.

252
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,700
The CEO is very angry.

253
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,946
Your outfit looks nice today.

254
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,662
It looks fantastic!

255
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:07,707
We will take action to make sure
the issue goes under the surface.

256
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,087
Dad.

257
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,183
Let me explain what happened.

258
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,270
-Dad, what happened was--
-Forget it!

259
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,396
We live in a world that only sees results.

260
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:30,357
A failed process… is just an excuse.

261
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:32,702
But, Dad, you should know.

262
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:33,949
What I need to know is…

263
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,912
how much the stocks
will plummet because of you,

264
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:39,121
how much loss
will be caused by the boycott,

265
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:41,202
and how much time and money will be needed

266
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,667
to restore this issue
and appease the shareholders.

267
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,748
Aunt is behind all of this.

268
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:52,384
Don't make this a family issue
or a fight for management rights.

269
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,722
-It's not that--
-Butler Chang.

270
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:57,263
-Yes.
-What do you think we should do?

271
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:59,972
I have submitted
a handwritten apology

272
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,426
to the newspaper company.

273
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,396
And Miss…

274
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:10,484
you should put your title down and
go away to let it settle down for a while.

275
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:11,987
Do as he says.

276
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:16,695
People will say I am running away
from the issue if I go abroad.

277
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:19,451
The issue doesn't settle down
if you go abroad nowadays.

278
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,406
I will make up for it.
That works too, right?

279
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,745
-How will you do that?
-I will just show good results.

280
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:28,332
You told me
we live in a world that only sees results.

281
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,008
Secretary…

282
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,431
please investigate the two men
who caused this incident.

283
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:42,274
Yes.

284
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:45,064
As soon as possible, please. Thank you.

285
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:48,685
Mister!

286
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:52,983
But I have to say--

287
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,188
If you're going to nag--

288
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:58,618
The flipping technique
was executed perfectly.

289
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:01,283
Really?

290
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:04,163
It is all thanks to your teachings.

291
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:07,325
Next time, make sure to
reach in your right hand a little deeper.

292
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:09,132
The right hand deeper?

293
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:15,165
Miss,
you did teaching during university, right?

294
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,470
-Yes.
-Then using that…

295
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:20,354
How is volunteering at the school?

296
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:22,429
The school?

297
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:25,597
No way.

298
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,564
Mister, are you being serious?

299
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:45,754
Why? Was I snoring?

300
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:48,578
Just go back to sleep.

301
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,127
-You scared me.
-Go to sleep.

302
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,546
Jeju Island?

303
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:02,221
I will try to fast-forward my life plans.

304
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:04,354
Mister…

305
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:07,807
Is this really the best option?

306
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:09,852
Of course, it is the second-best option.

307
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:13,395
But isn't this better than going abroad?

308
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,948
Okay. Then let me go to Tamra High School.

309
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:24,449
Tamra?

310
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:27,117
Is this really right?

311
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,170
My life is so dramatic.

312
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:35,836
You scared me.

313
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,643
You are not moving.
Why do you have so much luggage?

314
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:48,733
This is not much. Let's hurry and go.

315
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,350
You have to buy me something good to eat--

316
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,351
Wait!

317
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:55,858
Don't come near! Stop taking photos!

318
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:59,025
Please wait!

319
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,320
Hurry and go on first.

320
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:03,111
Don't come near!

321
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:07,043
-Secretary Kang! Where's the car?
-Parking lot D!

322
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:13,785
Get away! Do not come near!

323
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:25,854
The sun set already.

324
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:56,542
Secretary Kang, you still couldn't escape?

325
00:22:57,168 --> 00:23:00,298
Wow. I am at parking lot D now.

326
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:03,966
Wait a moment. Where is the car?

327
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:08,546
Okay, I found it.

328
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:10,058
Hurry up and get out of there.

329
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:12,023
Okay.

330
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:24,401
Excuse me.

331
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:27,656
Are you okay?

332
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:42,212
So it's you.

333
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:56,357
Miss?

334
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,490
Miss, are you okay?

335
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:04,326
What happened to me?

336
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,210
The airport…
Woman wearing a wedding dress.

337
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:10,539
Right! The man in the black suit.

338
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,876
There was a man wearing a black suit.

339
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:16,297
You are scaring me!

340
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:18,757
What do you mean by a wedding dress?

341
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:20,675
A black suit?

342
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:23,675
Was he wearing a black gat as well?

343
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:27,142
I'm not sure.
Did you not see anyone with a black suit?

344
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:28,354
I didn't see anyone.

345
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:31,306
You were unconscious in the parking lot.

346
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,811
It was hectic over there.

347
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:35,688
I don't care about that!

348
00:29:36,484 --> 00:29:40,704
Did you really not see anyone
wearing a black suit?

349
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,159
I'm not sure about that.

350
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:44,949
But the truck was destroyed.

351
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:47,834
Anyways,
it is a relief that you are not hurt.

352
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:51,617
Where is this place?

353
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,341
Miss, this is where you
will be staying from now on.

354
00:30:10,935 --> 00:30:12,935
This place looks like a secret fortress.

355
00:30:13,938 --> 00:30:16,018
Must I stay in a place like this?

356
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:19,784
Butler Jang said the hotel
will have too many eyes watching.

357
00:30:21,362 --> 00:30:22,402
That's true.

358
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,030
-Secretary Kang.
-Yes?

359
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:26,195
Didn't you see
anyone with a black suit?

360
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:28,409
At the airport.

361
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:31,325
What's wrong with you?

362
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:38,586
Where are you going? Go with me!

363
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:49,557
You are up to this again?

364
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:53,265
You can stop it now.

365
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:54,976
What brings you here?

366
00:30:56,105 --> 00:30:57,475
I came to ask you something.

367
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,280
Last night,
the whole earth and water began to shake.

368
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:05,241
The wind started blowing
from all directions.

369
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:08,032
My heart began pounding.
It troubled me. It felt familiar.

370
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,657
It is because you lived for too long.

371
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:12,124
Lying through your teeth…

372
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:15,504
The child is here, right?

373
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:19,171
Does the child look the same as her?

374
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,548
I guess that's how you recognized her.

375
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:29,558
Did she recognize you?

376
00:31:30,598 --> 00:31:31,638
No.

377
00:31:34,143 --> 00:31:36,273
Is she not fully awoken yet?

378
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:39,979
Why is she here at Tamra, then?

379
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:42,032
This place is not that far.

380
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:46,448
Do you still not get it
after living for so long?

381
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,236
Humans have causation

382
00:31:49,325 --> 00:31:51,405
and must have fate connected to meet.

383
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:57,707
It is best if she were not just a shell…

384
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,130
The lust demon targeted her.

385
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:05,507
I guess she is not just a shell.

386
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:10,103
But… why do you look like
you aren't welcoming of her at all?

387
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:17,266
Your stagnant fate
can finally move on forward now!

388
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:26,359
TAMNAGUK- ANCIENT JEJU

389
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:47,932
They all seem to have died.

390
00:32:48,676 --> 00:32:50,006
Let's return.

391
00:32:58,268 --> 00:32:59,558
There is a child who lived!

392
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:04,319
He was the sole survivor
from the lust demon attack.

393
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,990
His entire family was slaughtered.
He seems to have no repercussions.

394
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:12,284
Five days later
when the red moon rises, let's proceed--

395
00:33:12,366 --> 00:33:14,076
Jongryeong, stop what you are doing.

396
00:33:17,538 --> 00:33:19,998
Baek-ju, you came.

397
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,304
I heard about everything.

398
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:31,385
Are you trying to raise
children into Demon Slayers again?

399
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:34,296
You have failed countlessly.

400
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:37,522
All you have done
is taking the lives of innocent children.

401
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,596
Jongryeong, please stop.

402
00:33:41,437 --> 00:33:46,727
If I were to stop…
is there another way then?

403
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:54,662
Already, an entire village
was slaughtered by a lust demon.

404
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:57,202
The barrier will not hold out much longer.

405
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:01,623
We have no choice
but to take the necessary action.

406
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:02,957
Jongryeong!

407
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:08,262
It is for the greater cause
and Taejang Buddhism's will.

408
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:12,434
And this is my royal order!

409
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:46,401
Do you know what this is?

410
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:53,898
An evil spirit that has existed
on this earth since the beginning…

411
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:57,488
A lust demon.

412
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:04,450
These wicked beings take unclean desires

413
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:07,918
or evil thoughts to feed itself.

414
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,300
These monsters
mercilessly slaughter all living things.

415
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:20,103
Tamra is a holy place that was made
in order to seal these wicked beings.

416
00:36:21,555 --> 00:36:27,225
However, it is impossible
to fight them off with human strength.

417
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:33,361
How much blood was shed
to catch this just one!

418
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:38,491
You all…

419
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:42,742
Things might be different
if you can endure it.

420
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:38,966
Let go of me!

421
00:37:39,383 --> 00:37:42,893
I said let go of me!

422
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:47,769
Let go of me!

423
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,413
You have endured it well.

424
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:53,785
You two are the only ones
who have survived it.

425
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,632
From today onwards,
you two will be reborn

426
00:38:57,711 --> 00:39:00,261
as Demon Slayers at this Taejangsa Temple.

427
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:03,298
From now on, your name will be Van.

428
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:05,303
It means one who has stone flesh.

429
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:09,063
And your name… will be Gungtan.

430
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:11,729
It means one who has swallowed an arrow.

431
00:39:12,601 --> 00:39:17,111
The blood of a lust demon
is already flowing through your bodies.

432
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:19,859
Half-human, half-demon.

433
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:23,107
You cannot live as a human anymore.

434
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:26,360
Thus, empty your minds as a human.

435
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:30,701
Wonjeong!

436
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:37,705
Do you not need to take a little break?

437
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:11,832
I was looking all over for you!

438
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:15,371
Miss!

439
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:18,127
What are you doing here? Come quickly.

440
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:21,591
Are you still growing taller?

441
00:40:21,837 --> 00:40:25,547
I tried to decorate it the best I could,
but it is still lacking.

442
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:29,014
Hello.

443
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:33,272
Welcome back.

444
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:35,641
Hello.

445
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:38,395
I am the principal
of Tamra High School, Lee San-il.

446
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:41,648
It must have been
difficult coming out this far.

447
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:48,239
-Nice to meet you.
-Thank you. Please have a seat here.

448
00:40:51,408 --> 00:40:53,328
-Have a seat.
-Yes.

449
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:57,365
As mentioned earlier,

450
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:02,165
our CEO is very interested
in the development potential

451
00:41:02,586 --> 00:41:04,086
of Tamra High School.

452
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:09,376
Somehow, our Tamra High School
and Daehan Group became connected.

453
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:12,681
I'm not sure what to do.

454
00:41:13,597 --> 00:41:17,347
I'm sure if the school cooperates well,
it will help the development for both--

455
00:41:17,434 --> 00:41:18,854
Is this a bridegroom meeting?

456
00:41:21,188 --> 00:41:23,768
As you may know,
I am here due to an unfortunate issue.

457
00:41:23,857 --> 00:41:27,357
Nonetheless,
I will work to the best of my ability.

458
00:41:27,444 --> 00:41:29,534
Principal,
please give me a lot of guidance.

459
00:41:29,613 --> 00:41:31,573
No, I should be thanking you.

460
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:35,287
I heard you will be building
a new auditorium for us.

461
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:40,002
Upgrading all of the toilets
to the latest one too.

462
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:41,251
Water purifier…

463
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:45,132
I even heard you will be placing
new lawns for the sports field.

464
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,670
I am so grateful
that I am at a loss for words.

465
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:51,762
The children are our new future.

466
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:53,603
They should not be getting hurt.

467
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:59,137
-You have such an inspiring purpose too.
-Is there anything else you need?

468
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:03,477
But… who is this?

469
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:06,939
-I am--
-Okay, shall we go meet the teachers?

470
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,029
Yes, let us go.

471
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:13,783
Hello. My name is Won Mi-ho.

472
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:23,502
As you may have seen in the news,
I am here to reflect upon myself.

473
00:42:24,084 --> 00:42:27,134
If possible, please spread the word
that I am doing well.

474
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:28,762
-That's a good idea--
-Principal!

475
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:35,351
After Miss Im retired,
the guidance counselor spot is vacant.

476
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:38,724
I am aware.
But there is no suitable teacher yet--

477
00:42:38,807 --> 00:42:40,887
How about we let Won Mi-ho take it?

478
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:43,725
All of a sudden?

479
00:42:43,812 --> 00:42:47,482
Miss Im used to be the ethics teacher,
and Miss Won Mi-ho here--

480
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:51,945
I'm not exactly sure what it is.
But I will do it. Guidance counselor.

481
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,360
Secretary Kang.

482
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:56,160
Yes?

483
00:42:56,658 --> 00:43:00,078
I will take a look around the school.
You should stay in the car.

484
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:01,251
Yes, I will do that.

485
00:43:21,016 --> 00:43:24,266
COUNSELING ROOM

486
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:50,304
Excuse me.

487
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:52,588
I'm not good at beating around the bush.

488
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,465
-You don't like me, right?
-Yes.

489
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:56,800
-Why?
-You don't know?

490
00:43:56,885 --> 00:43:58,635
-I don't know.
-Then I'll tell you.

491
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:04,931
A person should not do that
to another person.

492
00:44:05,602 --> 00:44:07,442
What did I do?

493
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,610
You shouldn't be surprising people
without any notice like this.

494
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:16,151
I'm sorry.

495
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:19,698
It's good you are sorry… you fox!

496
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:22,826
Hey!

497
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:26,161
I thought you were kidding
when you said you're coming to our school.

498
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:27,867
I wish it was a joke too.

499
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,957
It's so nice seeing you though.

500
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:35,337
The sun is setting.
How about we go tomorrow?

501
00:44:36,049 --> 00:44:40,049
Su-jin is waiting at the cafe for dinner.
We haven't met for a long time.

502
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:41,426
I am just a little worried.

503
00:44:57,529 --> 00:44:58,529
What is this?

504
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:00,373
DAEHAN HOTEL OWNER WON BO-RAM

505
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:02,868
BECAME CHAIRMAN FOR
DAEHAN GROUP CULTURAL FOUNDATION

506
00:45:03,493 --> 00:45:04,543
She must be crazy…

507
00:45:12,127 --> 00:45:13,497
Dad, how did this happen?

508
00:45:13,795 --> 00:45:16,545
Your plan to connect
the Cultural Foundation and the hotel.

509
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:19,591
Your aunt said she will lead it.
Give her a chance.

510
00:45:20,677 --> 00:45:22,507
How is this a chance? This is stealing!

511
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:23,715
Won Mi-ho!

512
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:27,933
Okay.

513
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:30,151
I will turn a blind eye to her chance.

514
00:45:31,104 --> 00:45:32,484
Only until I return to Seoul.

515
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:34,904
Just wait, it will not take long.

516
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:44,947
Miss, shall we return to the villa?

517
00:45:46,453 --> 00:45:47,913
No, Su-jin is waiting for me.

518
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:49,501
Just go to the cafe.

519
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:51,748
Okay.

520
00:46:02,594 --> 00:46:03,684
Yes, Secretary.

521
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:06,721
I did some investigating as you ordered.

522
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:10,685
But this was a bit unexpected.
I will send you the photo now.

523
00:46:11,186 --> 00:46:12,516
Good job.

524
00:46:30,163 --> 00:46:32,333
-Secretary Kang, stop the car.
-Sorry?

525
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:34,417
Why? Are you feeling uncomfortable?

526
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:54,227
Miss, are you okay?

527
00:46:55,355 --> 00:46:56,355
Secretary Kang.

528
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:59,685
-I'm such a fool, right?
-Sorry?

529
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:02,861
What are you talking about
all of a sudden?

530
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:08,243
You need two palms to clap.

531
00:47:08,952 --> 00:47:11,162
-I was only looking at one hand.
-What?

532
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:13,164
The men from the car accident.

533
00:47:13,623 --> 00:47:14,753
How did they know?

534
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:18,208
Mister didn't know
I was on my way to the art museum.

535
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:20,795
Only Secretary Kang and I knew.

536
00:47:21,673 --> 00:47:23,723
-Miss…
-What did my aunt offer you?

537
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:25,932
Did she offer you a billion won?

538
00:47:26,386 --> 00:47:29,886
Miss, what are you talking about?
Why would I…

539
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:42,324
Miss, let me explain everything!

540
00:47:42,402 --> 00:47:43,402
For me…

541
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:48,532
I have always hated relatives and family.

542
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:52,247
All they do is try to take away
and pull you down.

543
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:57,995
Rather… Mister and Secretary Kang
were more like family to me.

544
00:47:58,835 --> 00:48:00,745
Whether it was empty words or the truth,

545
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:04,005
if something happened to me,
you both would worry for me first.

546
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:07,590
I thought that's what family is.

547
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,599
Honestly, I want to know the reason.

548
00:48:15,435 --> 00:48:19,265
But it's obviously either money
or something about family again.

549
00:48:20,148 --> 00:48:21,728
If I hear that, I might feel bad.

550
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:23,650
Our fate ends here.

551
00:48:23,735 --> 00:48:25,395
I will do this job alone.

552
00:48:25,486 --> 00:48:28,566
If word gets around,
Secretary Kang can not get employed.

553
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:30,333
I have never betrayed you.

554
00:48:32,327 --> 00:48:33,947
If this is not betrayal, what is?

555
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:46,264
I was always on that side.

556
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:49,894
So I didn't really betray you.

557
00:48:53,598 --> 00:48:54,598
Miss.

558
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:58,309
Do you think this is the end?

559
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:04,226
Still… thinking about the time
spent together as your secretary,

560
00:49:04,317 --> 00:49:06,397
I will tell you.

561
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:08,486
This is only the beginning.

562
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:10,954
Those people…

563
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,330
Do you think they are doing this
just to bring you down?

564
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:18,081
-You don't mean…
-The world is easy for you, right?

565
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,170
Miss…

566
00:49:21,918 --> 00:49:23,088
you are living in a well.

567
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:26,917
The small world you see from the well?

568
00:49:27,173 --> 00:49:28,593
A world the size of your palm?

569
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,390
The world outside…

570
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:35,973
is much colder than you think.

571
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:42,519
Won Mi-ho!

572
00:49:44,399 --> 00:49:45,689
Get your head together!

573
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:47,645
Do you understand me?

574
00:49:49,946 --> 00:49:51,986
Put your right hand deeper.

575
00:50:22,979 --> 00:50:25,569
This car… you can take it.

576
00:50:27,734 --> 00:50:29,784
It should be enough for the severance pay.

577
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:49,264
It's not just you!

578
00:50:50,173 --> 00:50:51,513
It was difficult for me too!

579
00:50:52,008 --> 00:50:53,888
I meant to tell you first…

580
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:57,432
Miss, I'm sorry…

581
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:05,898
Why am I even crying?

582
00:51:43,142 --> 00:51:44,772
-Yes, Miss?
-Mister!

583
00:51:47,814 --> 00:51:49,574
Please send a car to where I am now.

584
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:53,860
Well…

585
00:51:55,404 --> 00:51:57,244
It's a bit complicated to tell you now.

586
00:51:57,573 --> 00:51:59,533
I am at the…

587
00:52:00,535 --> 00:52:02,405
I came straight down from Bijarim-ro

588
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:04,369
-Please come quickly.
-Miss?

589
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:07,039
-Hello?
-Miss?

590
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:10,134
-Hello? Mister?
-Miss? Can you not hear me?

591
00:52:13,923 --> 00:52:14,973
Why is this happening?

592
00:52:15,842 --> 00:52:18,012
Why is even my phone service not working?

593
00:52:42,869 --> 00:52:43,869
Secretary Kang?

594
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:53,920
Why?

595
00:52:54,589 --> 00:52:56,049
Do you have more to say to me?

596
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:59,591
You can not leave here.

597
00:53:00,011 --> 00:53:01,011
What?

598
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:04,681
Secretary Kang.

599
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:07,726
Do you still not
understand the situation?

600
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:50,393
Secretary Kang…

601
00:53:52,939 --> 00:53:54,979
It's… me.
