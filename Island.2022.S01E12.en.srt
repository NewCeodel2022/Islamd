1
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:23,482
ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS DEPICTED
IN THIS SERIES ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:26,068
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED SAFELY
IN THE PRESENCE OF THEIR GUARDIANS.

3
00:00:46,464 --> 00:00:50,384
Do you want to hear a story
from a long time ago?

4
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:58,142
It's a story from a long time ago,
when Buddha was still in India.

5
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:03,856
At the time, there was a person
called Aṅgulimāla.

6
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:07,359
He was cursed,

7
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:12,448
and he could only be freed from it
if he killed 1,000 people.

8
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:17,203
Aṅgulimāla killed every single person
who came across his path,

9
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:20,414
killing 999 people.

10
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:25,419
So he just had to kill one final person.

11
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:28,547
But out of all people,

12
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:33,677
his mother, who was waiting for him,
came out to greet him.

13
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:40,893
So Aṅgulimāla had to kill his mother
as the 1,000th person.

14
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:42,978
That's when…

15
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:50,778
Buddha, who knew about this,
appeared in front of Aṅgulimāla

16
00:01:51,237 --> 00:01:53,739
and stopped him from killing his mother.

17
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:03,249
Since then,
Aṅgulimāla reflected on his wrongdoings

18
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:04,875
and focused on practice.

19
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:10,881
People would throw stones at him
and call him a murderer wherever he went.

20
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:13,008
But Buddha…

21
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:19,849
told him that he was going through
what he would have gone through in hell

22
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,727
and that he should endure it.

23
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:28,399
After enduring such painful practice,

24
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:34,572
Aṅgulimāla finally reached Buddha-nature,
entering nirvana.

25
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:42,788
If that's the case…
do you think we can be forgiven like him?

26
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:49,128
Yes.

27
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:55,175
Because you've both been through hell,

28
00:02:56,176 --> 00:03:00,139
which has been more painful
than any hell anyone else has experienced.

29
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:03,363
Jesus, eternal Priest,

30
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:08,035
keep Your priests
within the shelter of Your Sacred Heart,

31
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:14,291
where none may touch them.

32
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:21,507
Please protect this young priest.

33
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:49,618
<i>Johan, you've been asked</i>
<i>to carry too much burden.</i>

34
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:56,416
<i>I shall take over now and carry the cross.</i>

35
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:03,423
<i>I will pay back for your dignity</i>
<i>with my life.</i>

36
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:43,232
Mister.

37
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,115
You are still reckless.

38
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,957
What is this?
It seems to work against lust demons.

39
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,084
You should protect yourself, Miss.

40
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,963
These are silver bullets
filled with holy water.

41
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,425
I can always count on you.

42
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:24,374
Gungtan.

43
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:27,085
Won Mi-ho.

44
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,309
You should have just run away.

45
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:47,731
Miss…

46
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:51,360
You will soon realize…

47
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,030
how foolish your decision was.

48
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:58,533
The air on Jeju Island is fresh, right?

49
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:00,869
Take a big breath in.

50
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:04,498
Because I'm going to send you back
to hell again.

51
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,666
Was it nice back in there?

52
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:15,801
I will kill you right now.

53
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,080
Where have you been all this time?

54
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,124
I've asked you to take good care of Miss.

55
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:48,875
I was a little busy.

56
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,419
Van, are you okay?

57
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:52,712
Sorry for being late.

58
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,007
Van.

59
00:11:58,385 --> 00:11:59,469
I must go.

60
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:02,514
Yes, I already know.

61
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:08,854
Protect me, so that I can get up there
and create the barrier.

62
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:11,440
You can do that, right?

63
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:13,525
Of course I can.

64
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,237
Our contract is still valid.

65
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,035
Hurry, and open a path.

66
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,037
So hasty.

67
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,671
Just don't fall behind
and follow me closely.

68
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,780
Miss, please be careful.

69
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:43,532
You too, Mister.

70
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:54,644
Johan!

71
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,449
Johan.

72
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,743
Are you okay?

73
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,538
I'm the one
who should be worried about you now.

74
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:57,832
Are you okay?

75
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,835
Of course. Who do you think I am?

76
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:05,715
I must go and create the barrier.

77
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,593
-I'll come with you.
-No.

78
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:12,347
Please hold them off
a little longer with Van.

79
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,015
Until I create the barrier.

80
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:18,311
Don't die or get hurt, got it?

81
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:21,940
Go.

82
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:23,441
Leave this place to me.

83
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:27,696
I'm counting on you.

84
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:33,470
Won Mi-ho.

85
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:37,348
You can do this.

86
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:41,472
How could you not be scared?

87
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:47,812
In addition to your current life,
the memories of your past have been added,

88
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:50,148
so it must be a heavy burden.

89
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:51,858
Granny…

90
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,454
You can stop it now.

91
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,917
You know you can't beat me now, don't you?

92
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:56,422
I don't really intend to kill you.

93
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,217
You are the same as me.

94
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,929
You despise the humans
who made us like this,

95
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,681
and you also despise this island.

96
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:07,100
You're not some kind of protector
of this island.

97
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:12,188
We are just locked on this island
because of that bitch’s spell.

98
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,398
Shut your mouth.

99
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:17,986
It's a pity…

100
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:25,284
that after all this time,
you still don't realize you were deceived.

101
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:30,748
Come back to your old self,
and let's end this together.

102
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:34,877
This hellish island.

103
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:10,413
Johan.

104
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:14,709
Johan!

105
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:19,047
Did you call me?

106
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,132
Can you hold him off for a moment?

107
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:30,933
I won't be able to last long.

108
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:32,602
I'll be back soon.

109
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,409
So you've come
to change the place of your death.

110
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,745
I didn't think I'd see you again.

111
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:53,664
Because of someone else,
I cannot afford to be on sick leave.

112
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:56,084
Is that so?

113
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,420
You're back
from the brink of death,

114
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:01,255
so I wonder if you've changed at all.

115
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:06,469
Thanks to you,
my mission became clear for me.

116
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:12,183
I'm not simply following this path
to conform to Him.

117
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,603
So what I'm trying to say is…

118
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,775
that even if my God takes back revelation,

119
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:22,944
I'm going to…

120
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:26,197
protect my people.

121
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:30,284
You petty beings are making me laugh.

122
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:33,371
Try your best then.

123
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:39,997
Van!

124
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:29,588
I don't want you to disappear
by creating the barrier like this.

125
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:32,425
I also don't want

126
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:35,386
you to disappear like that.

127
00:26:36,304 --> 00:26:37,388
Did you know about it?

128
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:39,724
Do you remember what you told me?

129
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:45,062
You told me it was my fate.
And that I should fight it if I can.

130
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:48,983
You were right.

131
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:51,819
It is my fate and my burden.

132
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:55,072
There's no place for you there.

133
00:26:58,451 --> 00:26:59,827
You already know it too.

134
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,830
That I'm the same as them.

135
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:06,876
The fate was decided as soon as
their blood began running in me.

136
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:13,299
Won Mi-ho.

137
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:39,867
What are you doing?

138
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:43,537
Van, don't do it. Don't do it!

139
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:44,622
Van…

140
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:46,499
I'm really worn out now.

141
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:48,793
No, don't do this.

142
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:51,504
-It has been an awfully long time…
-Don't do it.

143
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:55,633
So I want to rest now.

144
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:59,595
No, please don't do this.

145
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:03,641
So please,
let me ask you for one last favor.

146
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:08,229
Please help me so I can rest.

147
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:13,192
It is my last request.

148
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:28,684
Van…

149
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:32,062
Van.

150
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:24,949
What's wrong?
You can't hold on any longer?

151
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,160
I told you, didn't I?

152
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:31,705
You talk too much.

153
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:58,232
You're back.

154
00:31:02,403 --> 00:31:04,697
Now you look much more like a brother.

155
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:07,866
Van.

156
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:10,578
It's not too late yet.

157
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:16,792
Together, let's slaughter
the humans who made us like this

158
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:21,589
and sever all ties
with the Law of Causality.

159
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:26,093
The Law of Causality will not be severed
by destroying this island.

160
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:29,179
After being surrounded by humans
for a few hundred years,

161
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:32,683
do you think you've become a human
or something?

162
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:39,148
You're also nothing more than a ghost
wandering in the human world.

163
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:48,490
The one who will complete you
is not that woman trying to be Wonjeong.

164
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:53,329
It is me.

165
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,082
Gungtan.

166
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,545
While you were sleeping
for a few hundred years,

167
00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:04,423
I only lived to find ways
to sever ties with the Law of Causality.

168
00:32:06,008 --> 00:32:08,135
But foolishly, I only learnt it now.

169
00:32:09,345 --> 00:32:11,930
That the only way
to sever the Law of Causality

170
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:14,850
is for you and I to no longer exist.

171
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,897
So you and I must vanish.

172
00:34:17,598 --> 00:34:21,435
<i>The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing.</i>

173
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:27,900
<i>He makes me lie down in green pastures,</i>
<i>he leads me beside quiet waters,</i>

174
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,652
<i>he refreshes my soul.</i>

175
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:35,073
<i>He guides me along the right paths</i>
<i>for his name's sake.</i>

176
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:10,043
We were together from the beginning,
so we should end it together too.

177
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:08,078
Why don't you work?

178
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:09,788
-What?
-Protect me.

179
00:38:09,997 --> 00:38:11,456
You said you would protect me.

180
00:38:11,999 --> 00:38:14,084
You promised to protect me!

181
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:16,503
I don't care even if you're a lust demon.

182
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,339
I don't care when I might end up dying.

183
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:25,512
I trust you.

184
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:38,734
You said it was a piece of cake.
Don't act weak, and get up.

185
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:43,363
You think I can't hold your hand
if you don't offer it?

186
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:45,323
You still don't know me?

187
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:51,246
For a long time,
you were waiting alone, right?

188
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:53,832
I'm sorry.

189
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:59,212
I'm not able to save you.

190
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,781
Van…

191
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:16,623
Van!

192
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:28,885
Father.

193
00:41:21,897 --> 00:41:23,523
{\an8}ONE YEAR LATER

194
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:30,280
I'll get going now.

195
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:33,325
Everything…

196
00:41:35,577 --> 00:41:37,829
must exist for Baek's purpose.

197
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:13,782
It's been a long time.

198
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:22,332
The person you came with
is the one who protected you, right?

199
00:42:25,252 --> 00:42:29,422
Someday, if the world ends up
covered in white light…

200
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:30,507
White light?

201
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:32,217
Yes.

202
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:37,973
If that day comes, the light will bring
all darkness into the ground,

203
00:42:39,266 --> 00:42:44,145
and all those who have protected you
will also vanish into that darkness.

204
00:42:46,815 --> 00:42:47,816
Are you scared?

205
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:49,442
Yes.

206
00:42:49,985 --> 00:42:54,239
So you must help us
in order to stop that from happening.

207
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:58,201
I'll give you power
to protect what is precious to you.

208
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:00,578
Can you do it?

209
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:10,630
However, on the off chance that the world
is covered in white light,

210
00:43:11,423 --> 00:43:13,967
then we will come find you.

211
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:21,516
We need your help.

212
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:33,153
{\an8}VATICAN MONASTERY

<i>What's wrong with your face?</i>
<i>You don't look like yourself, Giovanni!</i>

214
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:42,370
<i>Did someone die or something?</i>

215
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:44,331
<i>It's not like you.</i>

00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:53,882
<i>Are you thinking of Su-ryeon?</i>
<i>Or your brother?</i>

219
00:43:54,758 --> 00:43:55,759
<i>Or perhaps Van?</i>

220
00:43:58,762 --> 00:44:02,724
<i>Be our protection against the wickedness</i>
<i>and snares of the devil.</i>

221
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:04,601
<i>You know it too.</i>

222
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:08,980
<i>This is just the beginning.</i>
<i>And it can never be stopped.</i>

223
00:44:09,064 --> 00:44:11,941
<i>You poor thing, are you scared?</i>

224
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:14,277
<i>You are shaking.</i>

225
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:19,074
<i>Run away. Run away, Giovanni!</i>

226
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:21,951
<i>Escape this place!</i>

227
00:44:53,817 --> 00:44:55,652
<i>You know it too.</i>

228
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:59,864
<i>This is just the beginning.</i>
<i>And it can never be stopped.</i>

-Yes, Ma'am.

tomorrow's opening reception

234
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:31,521
for Hwang Mi-ri's solo exhibition
instead of me, right?

235
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:32,605
Yes, President.

236
00:45:35,692 --> 00:45:36,818
Thank you for your work.

BAEK

<i>Because I believed it was my mission,</i>

Johan.

Mi-ho.

244
00:48:41,753 --> 00:48:42,754
Yes.

245
00:48:44,756 --> 00:48:45,757
I know.

246
00:48:47,634 --> 00:48:53,222
<i>By burning everything I had, I thought</i>
<i>I could bring an end to the darkness.</i>

247
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:28,299
<i>I'm scared of a much larger darkness</i>
<i>that I didn't even know existed.</i>

248
00:49:29,509 --> 00:49:31,344
<i>Will he be able to come back?</i>

249

<i>Who else must I lose or let go of?</i>

250

<i>However, fear accomplishes nothing.</i>
