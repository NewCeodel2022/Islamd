1
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:23,482
All characters and events depicted
in this series are fictitious.

2
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:26,026
Child actors were filmed safely in
the presence of their guardians.

3
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:18,889
<i>Stop.</i>

4
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,183
Do you think I'm going to believe that?

5
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,022
{\an8}THE MAIN TEMPLE OF BAEK BAEK GYO

6
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:35,865
This is not a matter of believing or not.

7
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:41,537
Do you think everything
that happened to you was by chance?

8
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,163
Shut up.

9
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:45,833
You are a chosen person.

10
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:51,297
As we trust you,
please show that you're worth it.

11
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:55,009
I became a monster
because people like you deceived me.

12
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:57,887
I won't be deceived anymore.

13
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:03,017
And this…

14
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:08,814
will help you recognize it.

15
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:11,942
I don't know what you are up to,
but stop it now.

16
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:13,944
Because I have no intention to help you.

17
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:18,616
No…

18
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,037
We are not the ones who need help.

19
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:26,999
What can you possibly do
in the current state?

20
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:53,776
You bastards…

21
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:57,112
I'll rip you all apart!

22
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:01,075
There was someone called Jongryeong,

23
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,494
who I'm sure you know well.

24
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,621
You know Jongryeong?

25
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,668
He was firm in what he believed
and also had an extraordinary spirit.

26
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:15,506
He was the perfect person for our plan.

27
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,633
You bastard, who are you?

28
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,306
I controlled his mind

29
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:29,937
so that he would grow demon slayers
at the Taejangsa Temple,

30
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:39,613
with the intention of killing Wonjeong.

31
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,409
But unfortunately…

32
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:47,663
the plan had failed.

33
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:49,540
Because of Van

34
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:51,458
and you.

35
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:58,007
The reason why I have reawakened you…

36
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:10,185
is to give you a second chance
to redeem yourself for your failure.

37
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,628
Are you now ready to work for me?

38
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,433
The steps you and we are taking

39
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:36,021
are all for the existence
and glory of humanity.

40
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,817
So don't have any doubts about your path.

41
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,528
For humanity?

42
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:45,405
I'm not saying
we will save the current humanity.

43
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,451
For better…

44
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,039
For a more valuable humanity…

45
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,543
We call it…

46
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:02,589
the Sage.

47
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:10,722
For a perfect world

48
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:14,726
where the chosen Sages,
like you and myself, will live forever,

49
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:19,815
and for the Sages of the white…

50
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,567
A perfect world?

51
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,486
I have no plan to play along with that.

52
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:28,365
I'm going to kill the bitch
who locked me up underground

53
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,827
and kill every single human
who made me live as a monster.

54
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:38,417
Is that what you want as well?

55
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,462
If so, then I might be of help to you.

56
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:37,935
{\an8}What took you so long?

57
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:47,986
{\an8}I told you not to do unnecessary things,
didn't I?

58
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,740
Apparently,
Wonjeong is someone who fixes…

59
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,535
So I thought I could save him.

60
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:57,496
I wanted to share

61
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,040
your burden.

62
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:04,795
What are you doing?

63
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,130
Well, I thought this might be heavy,

64
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,799
but I had no idea it'd be this hot.

65
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,593
Has living around a lust demon
made you lose your sense of fear?

66
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,761
Is that so?

67
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,896
Do you think you can be friends
with a lust demon?

68
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,898
Please think.

69
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:26,566
Hey, why not?

70
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:31,113
I'll be friends with you.

71
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,239
With Mr. Lust Demon.

72
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,451
Let's be good friends, buddy.

73
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:40,330
Van.

74
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:43,834
Do you know why people are reborn?

75
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:46,795
They are born again

76
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,716
to repent for their past life
and wash away their sins.

77
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,384
How is your body?

78
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:53,677
Are you okay?

79
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,576
You still haven't found your answers?

80
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:29,254
Don't lock yourself up
in such huge confusion,

81
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:30,797
Father Johan.

82
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:36,762
Either way, there is only one thing
that you should focus on.

83
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:42,351
That would be my mission.

84
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:44,686
Right.

85
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,147
Your mission.

86
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:54,029
In the end,
it's to protect Miss Mi-ho, right?

87
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,285
It's possible.

88
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,003
It's possible because you're a human.

89
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,761
You'll put Won Mi-ho in danger again.

90
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:24,518
Humans believe whatever they want
and think it's righteous.

91
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,313
They also disguise it as a great cause.

92
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:33,735
You said you were testing me.

93
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:38,031
Think carefully
about who should really be tested.

94
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,523
<i>I now no longer know</i>

95
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:18,280
<i>which side is more righteous, Father.</i>

96
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,044
<i>Ms. Han has submitted</i>
<i>her resignation letter to the school.</i>

97
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,506
<i>Her parents already left as well.</i>

98
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:41,011
<i>She has not met anyone since the funeral.</i>

99
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,721
<i>Congratulations!</i>

100
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,140
Congratulations.

101
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:12,542
{\an8}<i>I'm sorry for leaving without telling you.</i>

102
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:16,213
<i>But I'm fine.</i>

103
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:18,632
{\an8}<i>I'll get better soon.</i>

104
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,885
<i>You know I'm brave.</i>

105
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,804
<i>So don't worry about me.</i>

106
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:28,600
<i>Eat well, and don't cause any trouble.</i>

107
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:30,810
<i>Let's meet again soon.</i>

108
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:33,855
As if you are fine…

109
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:47,827
-Let's go.
-Where?

110
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,413
I don't want to lose anyone anymore.

111
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:03,218
There is only one heart to bury in,
but there were 46 children.

112
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:08,431
So this heart

113
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:12,310
was torn apart into 46 pieces.

114
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:15,772
You're at it again. You're drunk, Granny.

115
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:19,234
If I hear it one more time,
it will be the 100th time…

116
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,611
No, actually, it will be the 189th time.

117
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,740
At least,
believe in something more interesting.

118
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:30,662
Sometimes, you can only see things
when you believe.

119
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:45,635
Let's say it's true.

120
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,054
Then where are all those children?

121
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,726
They are miserably standing.

122
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:55,020
Where are they? Where?

123
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:56,855
Tell me where they are.

124
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,236
I can see another one over there.

125
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,905
A miserable one.

126
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:12,120
Let me speak to you frankly.

127
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:18,001
How can I become a person called Wonjeong?

128
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:24,966
You told me that Wonjeong is a person
who fixes broken things.

129
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,219
I'm thinking of giving that a go.

130
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,598
And I thought you might know the way.

131
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:35,268
It's not something you can just do
because you want to.

132
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:40,565
Wonjeong spent her whole life training,
which was as painful as cutting bones.

133
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:44,319
Cutting bones is better
than having your heart ripped.

134
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:46,446
So please tell me.

135
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,448
Everyone only has one bowl in them.

136
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,577
To fill it with something new,

137
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:57,666
you have to empty it
as much as you're filling it.

138
00:15:58,625 --> 00:15:59,668
What are you--

139
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:02,796
You might not be the person
you were until now.

140
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:04,964
Will you still do it?

141
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,514
I'm doing it because I don't like
the person I was until now.

142
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:15,850
So my answer is still the same.

143
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:18,853
I'll try it.

144
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,267
You stay a long way over there.

145
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:00,937
Why?

146
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:15,910
Child.

147
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,205
Take a look inside this.

148
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,211
It will be a little hard.

149
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,567
What is this?

150
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:50,111
Didn't I tell you

151
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,655
that it is as painful as cutting bones?

152
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:16,221
I'll be waiting in the car.

153
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:21,893
What happened?

154
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:27,524
It's just the beginning now,
so why are you so surprised?

155
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,485
I wasn't surprised. I was just asking.

156
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:33,530
Even your excuse is lame.

157
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:02,016
Yeom-ji.

158
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:05,228
Su-ryeon said she
has something to tell you.

159
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:12,735
For me?

160
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:16,781
What is this?

161
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,117
It's a scarf.

162
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:25,331
It looked frustrating when I watched
my mom make one stitch by stitch before.

163
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:29,168
But, surprisingly,
time flew when I did it myself.

164
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:33,089
And also, I could sort out my thoughts
as time flew by.

165
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:38,511
It doesn't mean
everything is all good now,

166
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,179
but…

167
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:46,311
I'm getting better
at not trying to rush or force things.

168
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:50,273
You're doing better than me.

169
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:52,400
Sorry?

170
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:55,028
I had a moment to act quickly,

171
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:59,616
but I hesitated thinking
about what I should do.

172
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:01,534
But

173
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:06,164
I should take it stitch by stitch,
just like this.

174
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:20,053
Wow, it's really warm.

175
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:23,097
Thank you.

176
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,099
I should be thanking you.

177
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:29,354
You're quite skilled, aren't you?

178
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:31,564
How does it look? Pretty?

179
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,191
It's very pretty.

180
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:49,874
Say…

181
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:55,505
If I end up recovering my memory,
will I be Wonjeong or will I be Won Mi-ho?

182
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,342
What are you trying to say?

183
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:01,928
I'm a bowl for Wonjeong, right?

184
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,098
So it's more important to know
what's filling it.

185
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:11,062
The same way water fills a water glass
and drink fills a drink glass.

186
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:17,610
I have a feeling that no one will care
about the bowl itself.

187
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,112
So I feel a little uneasy.

188
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:21,239
It's not like you to worry
about things like that.

189
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:22,865
Just be yourself.

190
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:27,078
You just need to pour it out
if you don't like it. That's all.

191
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:31,708
You are right.
The bowl is the boss, like me.

192
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:34,961
Okay. Accepted.

193
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:38,673
The bowl is…

194
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:46,889
Mister, why are you suddenly asking
to go for a shooting session?

195
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:52,270
Because it seems like
you are very stressed these days.

196
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,607
There's nothing better than this
for relieving stress.

197
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,579
Wow, I'm a bit nervous
as it's been a while since the last time.

198
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,539
Relax your shoulders.

199
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:14,667
Do it like you always did.

200
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:16,252
Hold your breath.

201
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:34,062
You're still good, as expected.

202
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:38,649
You are the one who taught me,
saying I should be able to protect myself.

203
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:42,987
You were always better than the president.

204
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:46,407
So he was annoyed, right?

205
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:48,743
What's the point?

206
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:50,578
It's useless now.

207
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:53,664
Mister.

208
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:57,126
I'll be staying
at Mzee Geum Baek-ju's place for a while.

209
00:22:58,461 --> 00:22:59,462
Sorry?

210
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,638
Mister, I won't need this, will I?

211
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:11,682
Never mind this.

212
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:13,643
A jacket.

213
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,148
Did I leave anything out?

214
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:21,109
You've packed everything.

215
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:23,277
Everything?

216
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,363
How do you know that?

217
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:28,199
It’s difficult not to know.

218
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:31,786
Is it too much?

219
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:35,832
Since you're packing your things,
please take one of my things too.

220
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,084
Yours? What is it?

221
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:44,590
What are you doing?

222
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,557
No way.

223
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,937
But let me explain what happened. Johan…

224
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:00,565
Being by myself is lonely and depressing.

225
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:04,443
I can split you into two.
Just pick between horizontal or vertical.

226
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,031
Horizontally.

227
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:12,785
He says he'll split you into two,
so why don't you give up?

228
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:14,453
Just let me come with you guys.

229
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:15,872
We're not going on a vacation.

230
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:20,209
Okay, then. Allow me to tell you
about some precautions.

231
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:24,422
Mi-ho enjoys a cup of detox tea
before breakfast.

232
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:28,467
And she always eats lunch at noon
and dinner at 5:30, every single time.

233
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:31,554
Even if it's a little late,
her awful temper--

234
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:34,599
I mean, she might be
a little too sensitive.

235
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:39,478
She also drinks herbal tea
that's good for sleeping before bed.

236
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:41,856
There are nutritional supplements
in the bag as well--

237
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:42,940
You should come too, Johan.

238
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:44,025
This…

239
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:47,320
Mi-ho, I'll take it.

240
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:58,915
GRANNY HAENYEO'S HOME

241
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:25,524
You're the one living here…

242
00:25:27,777 --> 00:25:28,778
Hello.

243
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:30,738
Your dress is so pretty.

244
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,241
-Mi-ho, her charisma is--
-Greet her properly.

245
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:35,868
This is Mzee Geum Baek-ju.

246
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,538
Nice to meet you.

247
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:43,542
If she's Mzee Geum Baek-ju,
the mother of all gods in Jeju myths…

248
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:47,004
Maybe not.

249
00:25:47,088 --> 00:25:49,966
Either way, it's an honor to meet you.

250
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:52,635
You're completely different
from Priest Chang.

251
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:55,012
Who is Priest Chang?

252
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,765
We should get going now.

253
00:25:57,848 --> 00:25:59,392
Where should we go?

254
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:00,476
Follow me.

255
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:02,228
Sorry?

256
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:03,604
Where are we going?

257
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:07,650
You can't take a divine training
dressed like that.

258
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,031
Follow me.

259
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:00,995
You stay here.

260
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:02,913
Why?

261
00:27:02,997 --> 00:27:05,958
It wouldn't do you any good
to encounter energy.

262
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:09,378
-Even so--
-It wouldn't be good for her either.

263
00:27:10,338 --> 00:27:13,841
Right now, even a single breeze
will disrupt her energy.

264
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:15,926
Okay.

265
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,261
But be careful.

266
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:19,555
Okay, you punk.

267
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:23,851
I won't even be breathing, so this way…

268
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:26,562
Hey, can't I also go?

269
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,312
Receive energy from the ground
with your entire body.

270
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:21,575
I'm only going to tell you once,
so listen carefully.

271
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:27,540
In general, the barrier
is the unification of energy.

272
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:31,252
There are five energies
that make up this world.

273
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:36,924
Water, soil, wind, sun, and sky.

274
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:41,429
Receive all of these with your body
and put them in order.

275
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:44,140
Once these energies become firm,

276
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:46,809
you need to be able
to intertwine them in your mind

277
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:49,520
and release them from your body.

278
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:53,357
Intertwine energies and release them?

279
00:28:55,693 --> 00:28:56,694
How?

280
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:00,948
It won't be difficult.

281
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:06,662
Remember how I said
you had to shine from the inside?

282
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:11,750
There is something inside you.

283
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,129
Magic Marvel.

284
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:19,049
Once it's filled with energy,

285
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:21,385
it will naturally shine.

286
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:25,848
Last time, it was just an introduction.

287
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,894
As the energy grows,
the pain will also become more intense.

288
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:34,356
Meditate at a location
where water and land come together,

289
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,525
and embrace the energy of the land.

290
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,778
Then the way to the ocean will open.

291
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:45,493
When it connects to the energy of water
in humans and creates a path,

292
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:47,244
finally,

293
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:50,664
it will begin to flow.

294
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:12,645
Why are you back alone?

295
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:15,648
I taught her everything I need to,
you can go now.

296
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:17,733
But

297
00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:21,820
stay at least 50 steps away from her.
Don't go any closer.

298
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:24,490
Okay.

299
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,868
-I'll go that way--
-Come this way!

300
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:31,372
-That way--
-You're going to leave an old lady alone?

301
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:36,627
Let's go then.

302
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:17,835
Why am I doing this?

303
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:23,257
It's said that the flavor of food
comes from hands and fire.

304
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:25,509
Are you going to cook chicken
or something?

305
00:31:28,012 --> 00:31:32,057
Making fire from the wood
that is full of energy from the mountains

306
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:36,604
and heating water from the mountains
with it will produce excellent medicine.

307
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:41,233
Because she's forcefully filling, Mi-ho…

308
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:44,820
That child will develop a fever
within herself.

309
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:50,159
But as her inner self becomes hot,
her outer self will become as cold as ice.

310
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:55,164
So after training each day,
she needs to place her body in hot water

311
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:58,083
to help with circulation
between her outer and inner selves.

312
00:32:00,628 --> 00:32:01,629
Yes, Ma'am.

313
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:11,263
-Why are you helping?
-Sorry?

314
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:15,017
Why are you helping
to awaken Wonjeong's power?

315
00:32:16,018 --> 00:32:19,897
To save the world.
That's also the reason I was born.

316
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,942
What if someone must be hurt
in order to awaken Wonjeong's power?

317
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:28,781
Will you still want to awaken her power?

318
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:36,372
Is it more important to you
to save the whole world, with sacrifices,

319
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:39,625
or to protect someone,
even if it's just one person?

320
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:47,508
If you can't come up with the answer,
at least make up your mind.

321
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:50,678
If you do that,
you'll see the end either way.

322
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:38,851
What's up? When did you get here?

323
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:40,602
I didn't even know you came.

324
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:42,354
Are you okay?

325
00:33:42,563 --> 00:33:45,482
Of course. Something like this
is a piece of cake.

326
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:58,036
You said it's a piece of cake.

327
00:33:58,871 --> 00:34:00,289
Don't act weak, and get up.

328
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:05,002
You think I can't hold your hand
if you don't offer it?

329
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:06,211
You still don't know me?

330
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:11,967
What is it?

331
00:34:12,301 --> 00:34:15,387
Why are you putting on a serious face?
It's making me embarrassed.

332
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:17,514
Forget it.

333
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:20,642
You're so cheap,
so I'll just get up myself.

334
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:24,104
It's awfully cold.

335
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:35,282
What are you doing?

336
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:37,826
Hey.

337
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:41,747
You could put it on more nicely.
Is this headdress or something?

338
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:49,338
So did Wonjeong do this for decades?

339
00:34:50,464 --> 00:34:51,465
How?

340
00:34:52,341 --> 00:34:55,260
Never mind that. What was Wonjeong like?

341
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:02,017
Who knows? It might help me
get my memory back.

342
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:07,940
She was a gentle yet firm person.

343
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:10,859
What else?

344
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:14,446
I don't remember.

345
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:16,824
Why? Because you're too old?

346
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:18,617
What?

347
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:21,036
Tell me honestly.

348
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:22,955
How old are you really?

349
00:35:23,497 --> 00:35:25,582
What about your birthday?
Do you remember it?

350
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,544
I don't know. I don't remember it either.

351
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:30,462
Why? Is it also because you're too old?

352
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:32,965
Birthday?

353
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:37,594
I was born and raised by parents
who couldn't afford to celebrate it.

354
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:40,514
And since the day they died,
I've been raised to be a monster.

355
00:35:41,098 --> 00:35:42,516
So I don't remember such a thing.

356
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:52,192
What's wrong?

357
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,154
It's just that…

358
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:01,326
I was just hoping
that all the time you went through,

359
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:05,998
which I know nothing about,
was not the worst.

360
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:15,716
Let's go together!

361
00:36:27,728 --> 00:36:29,605
Johan, what are you doing?

362
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:33,025
Mi-ho.

363
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:36,486
You're okay with a lower-body bath, right?

364
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:38,947
A lower-body bath?

365
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:47,289
Come, Mi-ho.

366
00:36:51,168 --> 00:36:52,294
It looks delicious.

367
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,171
Ma'am, where is Yeom-ji?

368
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:56,882
I've sent her to her friend's place
for a few days.

369
00:36:57,341 --> 00:36:58,342
Granny.

370
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:03,138
Then you should also train.

371
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:05,891
I think it was as good as training for me.

372
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:07,893
Tomorrow will be even more difficult.

373
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:11,772
Eat, don't do anything else,
and go to sleep early.

374
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:14,316
-Okay.
-Come on, eat up.

375
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,944
Granny, you always put this in.

376
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:20,739
No.

377
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,715
You can take a day off
if you're exhausted.

378
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:04,885
Are you worried about me now?

379
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,803
Worried?

380
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:10,766
It's because this is something
that cannot be done in a rush.

381
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:15,020
You were the one rushing me before…

382
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:26,907
Eat before continuing.

383
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:30,327
You can't train when you're hungry.

384
00:39:48,929 --> 00:39:50,680
At this rate, you'll collapse first.

385
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:58,230
It's nothing compared to
what that child is going through.

386
00:39:58,313 --> 00:39:59,314
Granny!

387
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:08,031
You said you'd be there for longer.
Why did you return so soon?

388
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:10,242
Look at your face!

389
00:40:10,534 --> 00:40:11,785
How can I not return?

390
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:14,871
Why is Ms. Won staying here so long?

391
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,915
I was on my way
with the food I packed for you.

392
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:17,999
Oh my.

393
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:20,252
You only know how to take care of others.

394
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:21,545
Let's go and eat quickly.

395
00:40:21,837 --> 00:40:24,214
You've raised her well.
She'd survive anywhere.

396
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:27,217
I'd still be afraid
to let her go elsewhere.

397
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,301
Let's go.

398
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:29,386
Here you go.

399
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:32,597
-Oh my. You've made a lot of food.
-Right?

400
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:33,849
It looks good.

401
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:35,475
Shall we eat now, then?

402
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:55,078
Wait…

403
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:08,508
This energy is…

404
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,801
Why? What?

405
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:11,803
Why?

406
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:10,255
