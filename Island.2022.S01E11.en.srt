1
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:23,482
ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS DEPICTED
IN THIS SERIES ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:26,068
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED SAFELY
IN THE PRESENCE OF THEIR GUARDIANS.

3
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:40,833
-Run away!
-Help!

4
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:19,538
Oh no!

5
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,586
Are you okay?

6
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:28,798
You're okay. Are you okay?
You're okay, now.

7
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:30,508
Oh my gosh.

8
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:46,732
Granny, run away, right now!

9
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:50,569
Why should I run away?
This is my home.

10
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:52,488
You'll die if you don't run away.

11
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:53,948
Uncle…

12
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,492
Uncle Gungtan…

13
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,915
I’ve sold all of your children out.

14
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:07,503
Take off. Go anywhere across the ocean.

15
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,338
Go as far as you can,

16
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,841
to someplace where he can’t find you.

17
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:14,927
Let’s just eat.

18
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:18,806
You've known all along?

19
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,608
You've known… Then why?

20
00:02:35,406 --> 00:02:36,991
I mean, why would you do that?

21
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:43,873
You were so brittle.

22
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:47,835
I was afraid
that you'd break apart any minute.

23
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:54,383
Your heart was broken
because of your parents’ sins.

24
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:57,219
Seeing you reminded me of my sins.

25
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:02,057
It weighed heavily on my heart.

26
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,102
That's why

27
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:10,107
I wanted to piece your broken heart
back together, one shard at a time.

28
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,319
So that you'll be strong.

29
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,614
I wanted to take care of you

30
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,366
like you had never been broken before.

31
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,952
But,

32
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:25,080
looking back, what filled me inside

33
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:26,582
were not my sins.

34
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:29,877
It was you.

35
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:34,632
Oh, you poor thing.

36
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,970
It’s all my fault.

37
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:42,806
I can’t even

38
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,685
take care of you, just one person.

39
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:52,399
How am I going to wash away all my sins?

40
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:54,777
What are you saying?

41
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:56,570
I'm not worthy of that.

42
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:03,744
This Granny…

43
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,792
…has lived here since Tamra was founded.

44
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,671
Do you know how Tamra was created?

45
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,970
Tamra was founded by grandmothers.

46
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:25,891
Everyone who lives here

47
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:27,977
has grandmothers.

48
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:31,730
When the grandchildren
of those grandmothers become old

49
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:33,649
and become grandmothers again,

50
00:04:33,983 --> 00:04:37,486
they take over a piece of this island

51
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,699
and protect it their whole life.

52
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,370
Yeom-ji,

53
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:50,874
you’re still a child,

54
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:54,378
so you'd think
that you feel hurt, overwhelmed,

55
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,339
and that your heart would break
at any moment.

56
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,009
But one day,

57
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:04,972
you will become a grandmother
who embraces this Tamra and so much more.

58
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:09,560
I took you in
when you lived on the streets.

59
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:14,815
I hoped you'd do the same
and share your joy with other children.

60
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:19,111
That was my dream.

61
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:48,515
Uncle.

62
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,233
I’m sorry, Uncle.

63
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:02,154
But I know everything now.

64
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,948
I know where
the rest of the Hareubangs are.

65
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,242
You don’t need Granny now, do you?

66
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:09,578
I’m the only one you need!

67
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:20,172
Hasn’t she told you
about the Law of Causality?

68
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,302
I was also just a child.

69
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,306
The pain was tearing my whole body

70
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,142
that I couldn't tell apart
heaven and earth that day.

71
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:34,478
At that place,

72
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,857
Geum Baek-ju was with us.

73
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:40,442
What?

74
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,153
Children who had lost their parents
died in silence.

75
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,990
That was clearly murder.

76
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:51,370
She knew everything
but turned a blind eye.

77
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,499
It's time she pays for her sins.

78
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,050
All right,

79
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:06,135
I won't go.

80
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:13,809
I'd better let her come to us.

81
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:15,811
Uncle…

82
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:24,862
I forgot

83
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,949
that you're also just a mere human.

84
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,710
I respect your choice.

85
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:43,005
So,

86
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,508
you must bear the consequence as well.

87
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:29,481
Van.

88
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:33,026
Did you see that? You saw, didn't you?

89
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:35,570
I think I can do it
with a bit more practice.

90
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,739
I mean, I can create a barrier.

91
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:39,783
-Stop it.
-What?

92
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:43,203
Hold on.
I may be able to create a barrier.

93
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,830
Please wait.

94
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,706
Just a moment. Come on!

95
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,753
I'm saying
I may be able to create a barrier.

96
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,215
Don’t do it. You don’t need to do it.

97
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:58,260
I mean, why? Come on!

98
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:02,764
Why? What's going on?

99
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,057
Talk to me.

100
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:08,145
Won't you tell me?

101
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:11,189
Just leave.

102
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,326
I don’t want it.

103
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:24,953
You don't want what?

104
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:27,330
I don’t want you to disappear.

105
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:09,516
Granny.

106
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:17,065
Granny!

107
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:23,780
Welcome.

108
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:26,116
Ms. Geum Baek-ju.

109
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,499
I want my child back.

110
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:37,919
Let me see.

111
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:39,045
How dare you!

112
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,644
Did you take my child away

113
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:56,479
just to show off this cheap trick?

114
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,398
Did you say my child?

115
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:03,194
How nice to have many children to protect.

116
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:05,780
But,

117
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:11,828
I lost count.
How many of them have I killed?

118
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:22,464
You should try to save at least one.

119
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:27,510
Or at least the one that you can see.

120
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,436
Sweetheart!

121
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,858
Granny… run away.

122
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,235
Release her, right now!

123
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,159
You know what I want.

124
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:55,038
Tell me the location
of the rest of your children.

125
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:58,208
Stab me.

126
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:03,338
That way, my spirit
will go to my children, won’t it?

127
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:07,592
Sweetheart!

128
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,686
I knew it.

129
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:21,815
It’s that way.

130
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:26,820
Shall we continue where we left off?

131
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,697
You scum,

132
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:31,574
you have committed too many sins.

133
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,743
Instead of Granny…

134
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:37,497
…kill me.

135
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,500
Please spare Granny.

136
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:42,460
If you wish.

137
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:46,631
If you want to save your child
in front of you,

138
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:50,802
why don’t you let go of your children
who are already dead?

139
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,348
Neither this child nor I have much time.

140
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:58,309
So tell me.

141
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,365
No!

142
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:38,892
Granny…

143
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,862
Baek-ju is wailing.

144
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,449
The barrier stones are crying in response.

145
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:57,660
Of course.

146
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:00,246
Children listen to their mothers.

147
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,545
They must respond
to their mothers’ crying.

148
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:11,841
Now, then, shall we cry one more time?

149
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,524
I see no regret in your eyes.

150
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,359
Leave Granny alone.

151
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:34,614
You gave your life up.

152
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,953
I'm the one
who has made it worthwhile.

153
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,287
You have.

154
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:49,128
But now,

155
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,508
I regret that I met you.

156
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:20,076
Here’s the gentleman
that I’ve seen from the prophecy.

157
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:23,413
The sky is especially dark here.

158
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,125
It’s so obvious where the bad guys are.

159
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:32,630
What are you doing here?

160
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:35,133
Granny.

161
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:41,347
Are you all right?

162
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:44,350
Go stay with Yeom-ji for a moment.

163
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:53,484
This is how I get to see the young priest.

164
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:57,322
Do you know me?

165
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:01,492
I know your brother

166
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:03,870
better than I know you.

167
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:21,971
What will you do with that?

168
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:23,181
What else would I do?

169
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:26,809
I was thinking, officially,
I will save Won Mi-Ho,

170
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:30,563
and unofficially, I will take my revenge.

171
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,902
-You’ll fail at both.
-We’ll see about that.

172
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,377
No matter how hard you try,

173
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,213
you will vanish
without even laying a finger on me.

174
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:58,299
Still, there's something
I would like to tell you.

175
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:02,595
What do you say? Do you want to hear it?

176
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:03,805
Would you?

177
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,586
You might be fulfilling God’s calling
by fighting me.

178
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:40,967
But the God you believe in
doesn’t care about your admirable mind.

179
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:51,185
When your organ was taken away,

180
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,523
when your brother became a lust demon,

181
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,151
and when you

182
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:02,196
killed your lust-demon brother,

183
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:06,868
where was your God?

184
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:11,831
Come on, you never shut up.

185
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:16,544
A trait of your species, for sure.

186
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:20,590
Talking too much
is definitely a trait of monsters.

187
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:25,303
Enough of that.

188
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:45,323
As you can see, I’m not like Van.

189
00:22:58,002 --> 00:22:59,170
Yeom-ji…

190
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:02,256
Granny…

191
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:05,927
Yeom-ji…

192
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:09,931
What are you doing here? Run away now.

193
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:14,477
Shall we try again?

194
00:23:16,354 --> 00:23:17,355
Stop it.

195
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:20,024
Just kill me instead.

196
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:28,074
Granny!

197
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:30,993
Uncle.

198
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:33,871
Stop it.

199
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:35,289
You’re making me cry.

200
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,000
Are you actually related or what?

201
00:23:58,646 --> 00:23:59,856
Stop it.

202
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,111
I’ll tell you everything. Stop.

203
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,543
It’s my fault

204
00:24:21,294 --> 00:24:24,755
that I didn’t care about
your loneliness or resentment.

205
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:28,259
Take that resentment out on me.

206
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:30,136
Shut up.

207
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:35,725
Stop building your bad karma
with innocent lives anymore.

208
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,894
One day, eventually,

209
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:42,815
you will realize
that your hatred was all for nothing.

210
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,629
Now we’re talking.

211
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:20,384
Baek-ju.

212
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,929
I’d like to express my gratitude to you.

213
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:27,057
However, didn't you state
the Law of Causality?

214
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,769
It’s your turn now.

215
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:34,273
You turned a blind eye.

216
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,567
It's your turn to be condemned.

217
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:50,498
<i>Granny!</i>

218
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:13,562
Come.

219
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:16,941
Van.

220
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:29,078
What is this…

221
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,496
Undo this first.

222
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,873
You hear me? Undo this now!

223
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:37,586
<i>I can't fight Gungtan with you by my side.</i>

224
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,007
Van, please undo this. Huh?

225
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,010
Van.

226
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:46,095
Van!

227
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:49,098
Undo this, please. Van!

228
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:27,344
Johan.

229
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:32,850
-How about Mi-ho?
-She’s okay.

230
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:34,727
Good.

231
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:45,988
Go to Ms. Geum Baek-ju
as fast as you can…

232
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:03,005
I’ll be right back.

233
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:04,965
Hang in there.

234
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:26,236
Granny.

235
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,168
Why are you showing up now?

236
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:43,879
Granny…

237
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:46,048
Granny…

238
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:51,428
Granny.

239
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:56,767
Why did you come here?

240
00:32:57,685 --> 00:32:59,061
You should…

241
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:05,984
You should be protecting her.

242
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:09,905
It's all right. Won Mi-ho is safe.

243
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:15,494
I’m being punished now

244
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:19,331
for turning a blind eye to you before.

245
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:21,542
Don’t say that.

246
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:28,507
I’m worried about you and this child.

247
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:34,722
I feel bad I'm leaving you behind.

248
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:36,265
Granny.

249
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:41,478
It's okay.
Everything’s going to be okay, Granny.

250
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:45,858
Granny…

251
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:11,717
-No, Granny!
-Granny.

252
00:34:12,301 --> 00:34:14,136
No!

253
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,596
-Granny.
-No!

254
00:34:19,183 --> 00:34:21,727
Stop teasing me and open your eyes.

255
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:24,605
-Granny!
-You can't leave me like this.

256
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:25,689
Granny!

257
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,275
-No!
-Granny.

258
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:32,279
-No, Granny!
-Granny?

259
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:34,740
Granny!

260
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:39,328
-No!
-Granny?

261
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,506
Granny!

262
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,221
<i>Van.</i>

263
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:24,683
<i>Granny.</i>

264
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:27,477
Granny.

265
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:39,823
Van.

266
00:36:41,992 --> 00:36:43,702
I have something to tell you.

267
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:48,832
I guess, now, you’re the only one
who can help her.

268
00:36:50,584 --> 00:36:53,253
The reason she hasn’t become Wonjeong…

269
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:59,259
The reason
she hasn’t awakened the power yet…

270
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:43,178
Inside you,

271
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:47,724
there's a marble called Magic Marvel.

272
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:56,274
I said you need to shine
from inside you, didn't I?

273
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,405
There's something inside you.

274
00:38:02,823 --> 00:38:04,449
Magic Marvel.

275
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:09,037
Yes, I remember. The Magic Marvel.

276
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:12,582
Ms. Geum Baek-ju told me about it.

277
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:18,964
The power to create a barrier
is inside that marble.

278
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:27,639
-But, I haven't yet--
-You're right.

279
00:38:27,723 --> 00:38:30,684
You haven’t fully awakened that power yet.

280
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:34,479
That’s because the marble is not whole.

281
00:38:34,855 --> 00:38:37,065
What do you mean it's not intact?

282
00:38:37,149 --> 00:38:41,028
A fragment of the broken marble
entered your body.

283
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:59,796
<i>A crack smaller than dust</i>
<i>was where everything started.</i>

284
00:39:01,465 --> 00:39:04,885
It’s not Mi-ho,

285
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:08,513
but it's the Magic Marvel inside her

286
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:12,934
which is not whole.

287
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:19,232
That's the reason Van has become weaker
the more he has been around you.

288
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:23,028
<i>It was only when he touched you</i>

289
00:39:23,737 --> 00:39:27,449
<i>that the Magic Marvel's energy in you two</i>
<i>could become whole.</i>

290
00:39:29,785 --> 00:39:34,081
<i>He has gotten back</i>
<i>everything he had lost as a human.</i>

291
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,086
What he had lost?

292
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:42,130
His heart.

293
00:39:44,758 --> 00:39:46,676
Even his affection for you.

294
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:53,016
So?

295
00:39:55,602 --> 00:39:57,187
What do I need to do?

296
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,271
Van.

297
00:39:59,106 --> 00:40:01,775
You know the cause.
You must know what I should do too.

298
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:04,319
You’ll have to make a choice.

299
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:09,449
If you give her the fragment
of the Magic Marvel that is inside you,

300
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:12,786
you will…

301
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:18,750
No longer be a human.

302
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:20,335
That's right.

303
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:24,965
Just as the embankment water
bursts out all at once,

304
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:28,635
lust-demon energy
will rush out all at once.

305
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:32,973
There will be no turning back,
and nothing will be able to stop them.

306
00:40:36,852 --> 00:40:41,648
But Won Mi-ho will get to live
if I do that?

307
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:48,029
What if I refuse the fragment?

308
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:51,241
If I try to create the barrier by myself,

309
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:53,910
what would happen then?

310
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:57,330
The Magic Marvel
will try to fill in the crack.

311
00:41:00,167 --> 00:41:01,918
Even if that means burning your soul.

312
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:05,380
You will end up losing your life.

313
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:09,509
So, what you’re saying is…

314
00:41:16,725 --> 00:41:17,851
it’s doable.

315
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:19,895
Even by myself.

316
00:41:21,438 --> 00:41:22,647
I can do it.

317
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:28,236
I can create the barrier
without Van's piece of the marble.

318
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,324
I mean, that's the only way
Van can stay as a human.

319
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,952
He won't be trapped in the barrier.

320
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:39,956
But you…

321
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:41,416
If it's possible,

322
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,753
that's enough.

323
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,382
That’s all I need.

324
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,520
Granny.

325
00:42:09,653 --> 00:42:13,657
I'm leaving you with all the baggage.

326
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:16,785
What’s wrong with your face?

327
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:20,288
Do you think it's unfair
I'm leaving to rest without you?

328
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:23,792
It has been a long time indeed.

329
00:42:24,251 --> 00:42:27,003
If I had to endure
all these tough years alone,

330
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:31,508
my heart would’ve been
endlessly heavy and gloomy.

331
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:33,593
But thanks to you and Yeom-ji,

332
00:42:33,677 --> 00:42:38,765
I've had warm and happy moments
every now and then.

333
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:43,770
Thank you for having stayed by my side.

334
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:50,110
Thank you, Van.

335
00:42:52,404 --> 00:42:53,697
Thank you for everything.

336
00:42:55,448 --> 00:42:57,242
Go rest. I’ll be there soon.

337
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:21,725
Granny.

338
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:24,686
What is it?

339
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:26,771
Ms. Geum Baek-ju?

340
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:30,525
We’re really running out of time now.

341
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:37,824
I’m sorry for forcing you
to make a difficult choice by yourself.

342
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:23,203
Won Mi-ho.

343
00:44:25,538 --> 00:44:26,706
After all…

344
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:57,862
Kill me.

345
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:04,035
You know everything,
what I've done to Granny.

346
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:08,081
So please kill me.

347
00:45:20,427 --> 00:45:22,554
You'll pay for what you've done.

348
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:26,766
Exactly for what you've done.
Just that much.

349
00:45:29,436 --> 00:45:30,854
Granny's death

350
00:45:32,147 --> 00:45:33,857
was her own choice,

351
00:45:36,276 --> 00:45:38,153
and it was the price of her choice.

352
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:42,323
Van…

353
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:49,456
So, live the way you’ve lived with Granny

354
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:52,500
and the way she had wanted you to live.

355
00:45:58,047 --> 00:45:59,090
Live that way.

356
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:07,348
That’s the price you have to pay now.

357
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:13,104
Van!

358
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:16,941
Don't die!
You must come back alive!

359
00:46:18,193 --> 00:46:19,277
Okay?

360
00:46:19,736 --> 00:46:20,945
You hear me, Van?

361
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:29,412
<i>The world seemed to have stopped.</i>

362
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:33,249
<i>As if the time, and the sound,</i>

363
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:35,627
<i>everything had disappeared.</i>

364
00:46:38,588 --> 00:46:41,674
<i>I knew that my life,</i>
<i>which seemed to never end in that space,</i>

365
00:46:42,634 --> 00:46:44,636
<i>was nearing its end.</i>

366
00:46:47,597 --> 00:46:50,266
<i>I must go to where she is.</i>

367
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:36,956
